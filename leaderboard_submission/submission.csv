'I am f****** James Bond': Sean Connery letter to Steve Jobs rejecting offer to appear in Apple ad revealed to be fake Thousands of James Bond fans were today taken in by a spoof letter from Sean Conney to Apple boss Steve Jobs in which the film star launches a rant at the computer chief. The faked A4 letter on 007 paper was published online claiming to have been a response from Connery to a request to feature in an advert for Apple. It purportedly shows Connery aggressively declining the offer and telling Jobs 'You are a computer salesman - I am f****** James Bond.'

Steve Jobs, a lifelong fan of James Bond (he’d originally wanted to name the revolutionary computer “Double-O-Mac”), instructed his agency to begin work on a special celebrity Christmas ad featuring 007 himself, Sean Connery — even though Connery had yet to be signed. “The ad was of dubious quality, clearly not one of the agency’s finer moments,” says Woods. Though Steve had a thing for Sean Connery, the feeling was not mutual. Connery was appalled by the “advert” Jobs sent across the pond and declined to participate in the misadventure on at least three separate occasions. Connery’s final rejection was accompanied by a note revealing one mightily peeved film star (see letter on right).

One would think that the only thing 007 Sean Connery has in common with Apple co-founder Steve Jobs is a penchant for cool gadgets but this morning’s tweets proved otherwise. The letter was created as a part of an article on the iMac by Scoopertino, a website specialising in “unreal Apple news”. In the letter, 'Connery' wrote that he did not want to sell products for Apple. ""I have no interest in 'changing the world' as you suggest. You have nothing that I need or want. You are a computer salesman - I am ------- JAMES BOND!""

An image of a purported 1998 letter from actor Sean Connery (famous for his portrayal of agent James Bond) to Apple CEO Steve Jobs, caustically rebuffing an offer to become a pitchman for Apple Computers, hit the Internet in June 2011. Despite the letter's seeming verisimilitude, it was merely a bit of humor created as an accompaniment to an article published on the satirical site Scoopertino, which spoofs on all things Apple under the motto ""All the News That's Fit to Fabricate"". Scoopertino's 19 June 2011 article entitled ""EXPOSED: The iMac disaster that almost was"" purported to offer a (fictional) episode from Apple's history, taken from the (equally fictional) book iMaculate Conception: How Apple's iMac Was Born, in which Apple CEO Steve Jobs supposedly sought to boost flagging holiday sales by soliciting actor Sean Connery to lend his name and visage to a 1998 Apple Christmas ad campaign: As [former Apple marketing executive Frederica] Woods spins the tale, it was just weeks before iMac's first Christmas in 1998 when slowing holiday sales rang the alarm in the CEO's office.

Faux 007 launching expletives at Apple icon fools British social-media guru and becomes meme material. First, the bad news. Sean Connery never actually sent a typewritten letter to Steve Jobs in 1998 refusing to be in an Apple ad. But the awesome news is that quite a few people believe Connery owns personalized stationery with a ""007"" vanity stamp in the corner and that he would have no qualms using it to dash off a letter dressing down Jobs by declaring ""...you are a computer salesman. The letter was actually part of a satirical article on the previously little known (and very specific) humor site, Scoopertino, which peddles Onion-style and tongue-in-cheek ""Unreal Apple News.""

The Apple satirical site Scoopertino initially published the fake letter on June 19. They claim that Jobs has been a life-long Bond fan who wanted to call the first computer the Double-O-Mac. Details of how Jobs tried to recruit Connery to flag up struggling sales in 1998 were said to have been revealed in a book on the history of the firm. But when the image surfaced on the internet it became clear that it had been faked. Twitter users soon pointed out that it was not an original. One wrote: 'The Connery/Jobs thing was definitely a fake, it turns out.'

1,Trump Administration claimed songwriter Billie Eilish Is Destroying Our Country In Leaked Documents,"What specific leaked documents from the Trump Administration allegedly claim that songwriter Billie Eilish is destroying the country, and what context or reasoning do these documents provide for this assertion?		
A Washington Post story wrongly claimed the Trump administration accused Billie Eilish of “destroying our country” — then spread like wildfire among the entertainment industry. The article on Thursday — in part about hundreds of celebrities being vetted for a Trump administration coronavirus ad campaign — included a misattributed quote from the White House about Eilish. “Donald Trump is destroying our country and everything we care about,” the Grammy-winning singer said at the Democratic National Convention in August. Citing leaked documents obtained by Democratic House lawmakers, the Washington Post incorrectly wrote that the Trump officials described Eilish as “not a Trump supporter,” saying she is “destroying our country and everything we care about.”

The Trump Administration Claimed That Billie Eilish Is ""Destroying the Country"" The Trump Administration Claimed That Billie Eilish Is “Destroying the Country” In a new story published by the Washington Post, an anonymous Health And Human Services employee revealed that the Trump Administration had hired an advertising agency and tasked it with creating celebrity PSAs aimed to lift morale. The whole thing was supposed to be done before Election Day and to get some famous faces to pull attention away from an entire country being sieged by the coronavirus pandemic.

Editor’s Note: The Washington Post article mistakenly attributed a quote Billie Eilish made about Trump to imply that Trump officials made it about her. In actuality, Trump officials were merely quoting Eilish, who said during the Democratic National Convention that Trump was “destroying our country and everything we care about.” In what would have been the biggest scandal in almost any other presidency, Trump administration officials attempted to hijack $250 million allocated for a coronavirus awareness campaign, with the hope of using taxpayer money to instead boost Donald Trump’s re-election chances. Now, leaked documents have revealed the administration’s notes on potential celebrity endorsements, including a concern that Billie Eilish is “destroying our country and everything we care about.”

UPDATED 10/30, 10:15 p.m. ET: An erroneous report from The Washington Post held that the Trump administration described Billie Eilish as someone who is ""destroying our country and everything we care about."" The quote was pulled from a document compiled by the administration listing several celebrities who were being considered for inclusion in a public health campaign. Correctively, the publication has stated that the report inaccurately attributed the quote to the administration. But it was, in fact, an earlier quote from Eilish, who shared the sentiments in a Bustle interview from August.

Editor’s Note: A previous version of this story stated that the Trump administration said in a leaked document that Billie Eilish was “destroying our country and everything we care about”. The document had actually quoted Eilish’s own comments about Trump, made at the Democratic National Convention. This story has been amended to remove this inaccuracy. A leaked document has revealed that Billie Eilish was among a number of celebrities and musicians blocked by the Trump administration from an advertising campaign aiming to raise spirits amid the coronavirus pandemic.
		

What specific leaked documents from the Trump Administration allegedly claim that songwriter Billie Eilish is destroying the country, and what context or reasoning do these documents provide for this assertion?		
The White House has criticised teen singer-songwriter Billie Eilish for saying US President Donald Trump was ""destroying"" the United States, according to a new report. The Trump administration had been planning to roll out a celebrity-endorsed public health campaign amid the coronavirus pandemic, and ruled out the pop star because she was ""not a Trump Supporter"". It also noted Eilish's comments from the Democratic National Convention earlier this year, saying she ""stated (Donald Trump) 'is destroying our country and everything we care about'."" New documents show the Trump administration vetted some 274 celebrities' political views and criminal history as part of the publicly funded campaign.

A screenshot of the leaked papers showed that Trump officials’ description of Eilish was clear — they said the “Bad Guy” singer “made a political statement on gun control in 2019; will be a first time voter in 2020; not a Trump supporter, stated he ‘is destroying our country and everything we care about.'” The flub was picked up by Vice editor Jill Krajewski, who noted that “an embarrassing number of music outlets” including Complex, NME, Consequence of Sound and The Fader aggregated the misreported Washington Post story. On Friday, a correction appeared on the Washington Post story. “An earlier version of this report incorrectly attributed Billie Eilish’s comment about Trump ‘destroying our country and everything we care about,’ to the team vetting her, rather than to her own remarks,” it said at the bottom of the online article.

Billie Eilish Is ""Destroying Our Country,"" Leaked Trump Memo Says The Trump administration seems to have made some politically motivated changes to a $250 million advertising campaign with hopes to “defeat despair and inspire hope” amidst the coronavirus pandemic. As reported by the Washington Post, Trump’s Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Michael Caputo proposed that the campaign's theme should be “Helping The President Help The Country,” according to documents obtained from a contractor working on the project. Like all memorable advertising, the White House was looking to enlist a few celebrities to help hammer home the message, and their list of acceptable candidates was very small, and very, very bizarre.

The Washington Post has since corrected the quote's attribution. A leading Trump administration official reportedly tainted a $250 million advertising contract originally intended to ""defeat despair and inspire hope"" amid the pandemic by, among other sadly unsurprising things, excluding public figures they believed were not aligned with Trump or his widely panned policy attempts. A peculiar amount of ire, per the Washington Post, was reserved for Grammy winner Billie Eilish. A document detailing the administration's problems with an assortment of ""at least"" 274 artists and celebrities who were being considered for the public health campaign pointed out that Eilish is, in fact, ""not a Trump supporter."" Furthermore, in the words of the document, the Trump team is convinced the 18-year-old megastar is ""destroying our country and everything we care about.""

Tragically, while so much of what Macron said accords with what the vast majority of French people believe (Muslim and non-Muslim alike), it leaves France’s Muslims backed into a corner. No matter how hard they try, they can’t be French enough unless they stop being Muslim and, in public at least, turn their back on their faith.

Nadars claim that the original name of the community was Shantror or Shandrar (noble one) which, in course of time, was corrupted to Shanar. Channar is a title used by the Ezhava community of Kerala.[6] However, there is no evidence to support these claims.[7][8] The origin of Nadars as a social group is uncertain.

A political observer points out that there is a Nadar leader in almost every political party.[55] The community has influential Tamil media houses, such as Dina Thanthi.[55] Crawford Young has said that: Today, the Nadars are recognized as an ""advanced"" community – a status reversal accomplished over the past century through caste horizontal mobilization of caste solidarity, challenge to servile traditional ascription through ritual transformations, effective utilization of modern opportunity through education and commerce, and skilful communal exploitation of the political arena.[56]

They commanded high respect among the population, including from groups such as the Nadar climbers, the minority Vellalars and the Brahmins.

A Facebook post said, ""Matt Gaetz has had numerous DUIs and his dad got him off each time. He was part of a company that had to pay 75 million in hospice fraud. This post is wrong. Gaetz had one DUI arrest in 2008, and the case was dropped. The post also includes a sloppy reference to a hospice company that Matt Gaetz’s father, Don Gaetz, previously owned. Don Gaetz sold Vitas in 2004. In 2013, the federal government announced a lawsuit that resulted in a $75 million settlement in 2017.
		

Has there been any credible legal or investigative reporting confirming that Matt Gaetz was involved with a company that paid $75 million in hospice fraud penalties, and if so, what specific role did he play in that company?		
Following the unsubstantiated claim of “numerous DUIs,” the social media posts continue: “He was part of a company that had to pay 75 million in hospice fraud. They stole from dying people.” As the post is structured, readers may interpret “he” to reference Gaetz. In reality, the claim relates to a company his father founded and later sold. In 2017, Chemed Corporation and “various wholly-owned subsidiaries, including Vitas Hospice Services LLC and Vitas Healthcare Corporation” agreed to pay $75 million to settle federal charges that the companies submitted false claims for hospice services to Medicare, according to the U.S. Department of Justice.

The Facebook post goes on to say ""he was part of a company that had to pay 75 million in hospice fraud."" That leaves the impression that ""he"" refers to Matt Gaetz, which is wrong. It was Don Gaetz’s former company, Vitas Healthcare Corporation, that was involved in litigation involving fraud. It didn’t involve Matt Gaetz, and the elder Gaetz was not named as a defendant in the lawsuit. In 2013, the U.S. Justice Department filed a lawsuit against Chemed Corporation and hospice subsidiaries, including Vitas Hospice Services LLC and Vitas Healthcare Corporation, alleging false Medicare billings for hospice services.

“He was part of a company that had to pay 75 million in hospice fraud. They stole from dying people. He is the swamp.” Like many claims that gain traction on social media, the posts have some factual basis but are muddied by misrepresentation, exaggeration and speculation. Court records and press reports show that Gaetz was arrested once, in 2008, on charges that he was driving while intoxicated — but the case was later dismissed, the Okaloosa County court docket shows. The posts offer no evidence that Gaetz has “had numerous DUIs,” or that his father, Don, a Florida state senator from 2006 to 2016, “got him off each time.”

In 2013, the U.S. Justice Department filed a lawsuit against Chemed Corporation and hospice subsidiaries, including Vitas Hospice Services LLC and Vitas Healthcare Corporation, alleging false Medicare billings for hospice services. The government accused the company of engaging in Medicare fraud between 2002 and 2013. At the time the lawsuit was announced, Don Gaetz told the Northwest Florida Daily News that he remained active in the management of Vitas until 2000.

We searched Gaetz’s name on Nexis and did not find any other DUI arrests. Florida Department of Law Enforcement records note only one arrest for Gaetz, in October 2008, related to a DUI misdemeanor traffic offense. Snopes, which debunked a meme about Gaetz’s DUI record in July, found that the earliest version of the claim stemmed from a 2016 post by a conspiracy theorist. The Facebook post goes on to say ""he was part of a company that had to pay 75 million in hospice fraud."" That leaves the impression that ""he"" refers to Matt Gaetz, which is wrong. It was Don Gaetz’s former company, Vitas Healthcare Corporation, that was involved in litigation involving fraud.

So if the U.S. had acted as effectively as Germany, 70% of U.S. coronavirus deaths might have been prevented. Seventy percent, though, is the most conservative estimate. Scaled-up versions of South Korea, Australia, and Singapore would have experienced 1,758, 1,324, and 1,358 deaths, respectively, in the four months after 15 cases were confirmed in each country. Had we handled the coronavirus as effectively as any of these three countries, roughly 99% of the 117,858 U.S. Covid-19 deaths might have been averted.

What specific sources or studies support the estimate that there would have been 160,000 fewer deaths from COVID-19 if different actions had been taken?		
More than 120,000 Americans have now perished from Covid-19, surpassing the total number of U.S. dead during World War I. Had American leaders taken the decisive, early measures that several other nations took when they had exactly the same information the U.S. did, at exactly the same time in their experience of the novel coronavirus, how many of these Covid-19 deaths could have been prevented? That isn’t a hypothetical question. And the answer that emerges from a direct comparison of the fatalities in and policies of the U.S. and other countries — South Korea, Australia, Germany, and Singapore — indicates that between 70% and 99% of the Americans who died from this pandemic might have been saved by measures demonstrated by others to have been feasible. At least three factors enable meaningful comparisons of these nations with the United States. First, we scaled up their population sizes and Covid-19 deaths to match those of the U.S. Second, in each of these countries, roughly 80% or more of the population lives in urbanized, transmission-prone areas, similar to the U.S. Third, the pandemic took root earlier in these other countries than here, as measured by the date of the 15th confirmed case in each, meaning that foreign leaders had to act with less information to guide their decisions than did U.S. leaders. To compare each country’s responses to the pandemic on a consistent basis, we turned to the work of an Oxford University team that has constructed a stringency index based on 13 policy responses (lockdowns, border closings, tests, etc.) to measure how strongly each country responded over time.

Now with the Delta variant and colder weather, the average number of daily deaths is once again well over 1,000. The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted health and safety in many ways beyond the immediate impact of infections. During 2020 the NSC estimates motor deaths increased 8% even as mileage dropped 13%. The CDC preliminary estimates also show that overdose deaths accelerated during the pandemic. The number of confirmed and probable COVID-19 deaths in the U.S. is estimated to be 377,883 in 2020. This total far exceeds 173,040, the total number of preventable injury death in 2019 (latest official count available).

However, with the increasing prevalence of the Omicron Variant, a fourth wave of cases is occurring. The rapidly changing COVID-19 trends contrast sharply with other everyday risks that we have become accustomed to, like car crashes, drug overdoses, and falls. Typically, injury trends change slowly over time. Comparing 2018, to 2019 (latest final data available), motor-vehicle deaths decreased 0.8% and fall deaths increased 5.3%. While deaths due to causes like falls and overdoses are spread out fairly evenly throughout the year, the timeline for COVID-19 deaths is compressed. During much of 2020 COVID deaths averaged more than 1,200 a day. Earlier in 2021, increasing vaccination rates helped to decrease the average number of deaths below 500 per day.

It is likely that when final mortality data is released for 2020, COVID-19 will be third leading cause of death in the United States, behind heart disease and cancer. Preventable injury death is likely to drop to the fourth leading cause of death behind COVID-19.

Our conclusions are strengthened by their consistency with the results from different methodologies. Two notable epidemiological projections, based on theoretical models of transmission and “idealized hypothetical assumptions,” have estimated that between 80% and 90% of American deaths could have been averted had lockdowns and social distancing begun two weeks earlier. For a more granular perspective, we compared the American response to the actions taken by South Korea. By the time South Korea experienced its 15th confirmed case on Feb. 2, it had spearheaded a massive public information campaign, mobilized private sector players to produce testing kits, and expedited regulatory approval for these newly developed tests. Within a week, tests were widely available. Within three weeks, schools and public spaces were closed, large gatherings had been banned, and 26,000 people had been tested.

Trump Paid $750 in Federal Income Taxes in 2017. Here’s the Math. Figures drawn from President Trump’s tax-return data show how that number was calculated. The small amount of federal income taxes President Trump paid in both 2016 and 2017 — just $750 each year — has become the focus of much attention since it was revealed in a New York Times investigation. The figures below, drawn from Mr. Trump’s tax-return data for 2017, show how his accountants arrived at that figure for one of those years.

Donald Trump 'paid $750 in federal income taxes in 2016 and 2017' - NY Times Donald Trump paid just $750 (£580) in federal income tax both in 2016, the year he ran for the US presidency, and in his first year in the White House, the New York Times says. The newspaper - which says it obtained tax records for Mr Trump and his companies over two decades - also says that he paid no income taxes at all in 10 of the previous 15 years. The records reveal ""chronic losses and years of tax avoidance"", it says.

NY Times: Trump paid $750 in US income taxes in 2016, 2017 President Donald Trump paid just $750 in federal income taxes the year he ran for president and in his first year in the White House, according to a report Sunday in The New York Times. Trump, who has fiercely guarded his tax filings and is the only president in modern times not to make them public, paid no federal income taxes in 10 of the past 15 years. The details of the tax filings complicate Trump’s description of himself as a shrewd and patriotic businessman, revealing instead a series of financial losses and income from abroad that could come into conflict with his responsibilities as president.
		

What is the exact amount of federal income tax that Donald Trump paid in each of the last ten years?		
President Donald Trump didn’t avoid paying taxes for nearly two decades, after all. According to a tax return that was leaked on Tuesday night, Trump paid $38 million in federal taxes in 2005, a year when the former New York real estate developer brought in just under $153 million in income. That gave Trump a surprisingly low total tax rate in 2005—just 25%—when, that year, the top marginal federal income tax rate Trump would have clearly qualified for was 35%. What’s more, the $38 million in taxes includes a payment of just over $31 million that was generated by what’s known as the alternative minimum tax (AMT), an add-on tax that is supposed to catch high earners whose income might fall outside of what is normally counted as taxable income.
		

What is the exact amount of federal income tax that Donald Trump paid in each of the last ten years?		
Trump’s tax payments that year also included $1.9 million in so-called self-employment taxes, which consists of Medicare and Social Security taxes. Those levies are usually on top of what people pay have to pay in basic income tax. Excluding those two payments, Trump paid $5.3 million in taxes on $48.6 million in adjusted income, after claiming a $103 million business loss that year for an effective tax rate of just 10.9%. In comparison, the average American taxpayer in 2005 paid an effective tax rate of 13.6%, nearly three percentage points higher than Trump.

Donald Trump said he's ""smart"" by not paying income taxes — and argued that if he did, the money would be ""squandered.""

""The only years that anybody's ever seen were a couple of years when he had to turn them over to state authorities when he was trying to get a casino license, and they showed he didn't pay any federal income tax,"" Clinton said. Later, when Clinton told Trump was that ""maybe ... you haven't paid any federal income tax for a lot of years,"" the real estate mogul, who claims to be worth up to $10 billion, said that he was a better steward for his money than the government.
		

What is the exact amount of federal income tax that Donald Trump paid in each of the last ten years?		
Yet the average American made just $38,754 in adjusted income that year, considerably less than Trump. Nonetheless, Trump’s tax payments are significantly higher than what some had earlier estimated. Last year, The New York Times published pages from Trump’s 1995 tax filings that showed the President had declared a loss of nearly $916 million that year. Tax experts told the Times that based on that nine-figure loss, Trump had the ability to use that loss to legally offset future income taxes, allowing the President to not pay taxes for the next 18 years. The 2005 return shows that Trump began paying taxes again long before some had previously thought. In addition to the final tax bill, the 2005 return shows that Trump paid $13.4 million in estimated taxes, paid each quarter throughout the year.

Trump’s accusations focused on noncitizen voting, clearly a nod to that portion of his base energized by Trump’s xenophobic, anti-immigrant messaging. Charging what would have been massive election fraud in any country, much less one like the United States where recorded instances of voter fraud are exceedingly low and elections are administered by states, Trump tweeted on November 27, 2016, “In addition to winning the Electoral College in a landslide, I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally.”14 That same day, he also took to Twitter to allege “Serious voter fraud in Virginia, New Hampshire and California.”15 Trump would later place the power of his presidency behind a fruitless effort to find fraud.16 In May 2017, he announced the formation of the Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity, an entity that “looked like nothing that had come before it,” as election law scholar Richard Hasen noted.17 Previous presidents had established such entities to study election processes and make recommendations, but those prior efforts employed election experts and social science data and were bipartisan in composition.

Must go with Election Night!”24 There was good reason to expect that these efforts would undermine public trust. A study using an experimental design, with a control group and a treatment group exposed to Republican officeholders’ tweets alleging 2018 election wrongdoing, found that the tweets produced lowered confidence in the election among Republicans and others who approved of Trump. This effect occurred even when fact checks undermining these claims were provided.25 As CNN’s Harry Enten observed after the 2018 midterms, “‘Voter fraud’ is too quickly becoming a synonym for ‘result I don’t like.’”26

Three of those states (Colorado, Oregon and Washington) have done the same thing in past elections, and two others (California and Utah) have done something similar. We don’t know where he got the 80 million figure, but voting experts expect that in total about 80 million mail-in ballots will be cast in the 2020 election — including by voters who request a ballot to vote, as is the case in most states. After we wrote our story, the president continued to push the baseless claim that Democrats are sending out “80 million unsolicited ballots,” or less specific claims about the Democrats sending out millions or tens of millions of “unsolicited ballots” to steal the election, despite there being no evidence of such widespread voter fraud. “We have not seen, historically, any kind of coordinated national voter fraud effort in a major election, whether it’s by mail or otherwise,” FBI Director Wray said at a Sept. 24 hearing, noting that historically it has occurred at the “local level from time to time.”

But facing slipping approval and reelection polls, Trump lambasted vote by mail, tweeting dozens of times between late May and August of 2020 that mail-in processes would be open to fraud and would constitute a rigged election. On June 22, he tweeted that foreign countries would print ballots to manipulate the election (despite the fact that ballots are verified before counting). Later that morning, he tweeted, “Because of MAIL-IN BALLOTS, 2020 will be the most RIGGED Election in our nations history – unless this stupidity is ended. We voted during World War One & World War Two with no problem, but now they are using Covid in order to cheat by using Mail-ins!”35 Evidence that Trump is intentionally undermining the election processes that might hurt his chances of re-election were most pronounced when, in early August, Trump advocated mail-in voting in Florida (where he thought it might help him) while denouncing the practice in Nevada and New York.36

Yet little hard evidence of widespread voter fraud has turned up.

After the 2016 presidential election, the largest investigation into voter fraud was in Tennessee. Officials there counted 40 credible allegations of voter fraud out of 1.3 million votes. The number was so low, it would not have affected the election’s outcome. Once in office, President Trump created the Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity to investigate election fraud. He had claimed that millions of undocumented immigrants voted illegally. By January 2018, the commission had found no evidence of widespread election fraud, and the president shut down the commission.

Allegations of voter fraud make for dramatic headlines, and many have appeared on social media in different forms since President Donald Trump started pushing such claims as early as the 2016 election. Most of these have proven to be unfounded or isolated in nature. Hundreds of thousands of ballots, however, are rejected or discarded each election for a number of reasons. More than 550,000 absentee ballots were rejected in this year's presidential primaries, according to an analysis by NPR.

Also, manufacturing's share of nominal gross domestic product (GDP) has dropped from 28.1 percent in 1953 to just 12 percent in 2015, as seen in the next figure. However, these numbers exaggerate manufacturing's decline. To see why, we need to measure the manufacturing sector's share of real GDP. The total value of goods produced is equal to the price multiplied by the quantity of goods produced. Removing the price effects from nominal GDP gives us real GDP, so changes in real GDP are the result of changes in the quantity produced.

Below, infectious disease doctors break down what you should know about face masks and COVID-19. Can wearing a face mask really reduce the spread of COVID-19? While doctors had mixed opinions in the past, the data is now very clear. “Face masks can help prevent the spread of COVID-19,” says William Schaffner, M.D., an infectious disease specialist and professor at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine. The reasoning is simple. Respiratory illnesses, including COVID-19, can spread from an infected person to others through the air after coughing, sneezing, and talking or by touching a contaminated surface and then touching your mouth, nose, or eyes prior to hand washing.

At first blush, this may sound as a small effect, but three weeks of cumulated 2% decrease amounts to a decrease of over 40%. Accordingly, from their data, the authors estimated that as many as 230,000–450,000 Covid-19 cases had been averted by May 22, 2020. Finally, a large comprehensive review and meta-analysis, published in the Lancet online on the 1st of June 2020, used data from 172 observational studies across 16 countries (among them 44 comparative studies in healthcare and non-healthcare settings [13]. Face masks (surgical type) reduced infection risk by 85%. Since face masks are comparatively cheap and easy to use, they are among the most simple and straight forward means to curb SARS-Cov-2 and Covid-19 transmission (see also [53]).

We conclude that wearing a face mask in public corresponds to the most effective means to prevent inter-human transmission.
		

Do face masks effectively reduce the transmission of COVID-19 according to scientific studies and health organization guidelines?		
Experts agree that wearing face masks can protect people’s health and slow the spread of COVID-19. That’s because the novel coronavirus can be transmitted through respiratory droplets that get into the air from sneezing, coughing or even speaking. A mask acts as a barrier, stopping those droplets before they reach another person[1]. But a mask is only effective if it’s worn correctly. Here are the do’s and don'ts of wearing a face mask. When you wear a mask, you’re making an effort to protect the health of others in your community, and you may also be keeping yourself and the people you love safe from COVID-19.
		

Do face masks effectively reduce the transmission of COVID-19 according to scientific studies and health organization guidelines?		
In addition, MacIntrye adds, “the design should fit around the edges of the face because air will flow down the path of least resistance.” In other words, if there are gaps on the sides of your mask, your breath will slip through those cracks instead of being filtered through the mask itself. Although evidence is building to support the use of masks to stem the coronavirus’ spread, many questions remain, such as whether the coronavirus spreads through aerosols or just through larger respiratory droplets. There is also little research on the efficacy of face masks, particularly cloth ones, in stopping the spread of COVID-19 in community settings, Julii Brainard, a senior research associate at Norwich Medical School in the UK, tells The Scientist in an email.
		

Do face masks effectively reduce the transmission of COVID-19 according to scientific studies and health organization guidelines?		
If you are wearing a mask and around someone who is infected, fewer droplets will get through your own mask. “In that case, you are probably getting a lower dose of virus, and that often results in a milder or less severe infection,” says Sandora. Is there any scientific proof that masks prevent COVID-19 infection? Yes. One of the most well-known studies was funded by the World Health Organization. Published in a major medical journal, the study compared potential COVID-19 infection rates with a mask versus no mask.

conditionally recommends face mask use in the community for asymptomatic individuals in severe  epidemics or pandemics in order to reduce transmission in the community; this is based on mechanistic plausibility for the potential effectiveness of this measure [20].

Do face masks effectively reduce the transmission of COVID-19 according to scientific studies and health organization guidelines?		
Face masks are a simple way to help decrease coronavirus transmission and save lives. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, wearing a face mask in public places has been shown to reduce the spread of COVID-19, because those who are pre-symptomatic can spread the virus before showing symptoms. However, some masks are more effective than others. Adrian Cotton, MD, chief of medical operations at Loma Linda University Health, breaks down how different types of masks protect you as well as how they are meant to be used. Fabric or cloth masks trap droplets that are released when the person wearing the mask sneezes, coughs or talks.

When the UN proposed arbitration, a reference to the World Court, or any other method of resolving minor demilitarization quarrels, India nixed them all. After a few years, it dropped all pretense of acceding to a referendum by unilaterally proclaiming its annexation of Kashmir. And Aug. 5, 2019, in violation of all international agreements, India abrogated Article 370 and 35A. India's proclamation has never been accepted by the UN, which continues to list Kashmir as disputed territory and subject to the Security Council's self-determination resolutions. The people of Jammu and Kashmir are thankful to UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres for stating the principled position that the Kashmir conflict should be resolved under the UN Charter and applicable to UN Security Council resolutions.

The Kashmir dispute is the oldest unresolved international conflict in the world today. Pakistan considers Kashmir as its core political dispute with India. India's forcible occupation of the State of Jammu and Kashmir in 1947 is the main cause of the dispute. India claims to have 'signed' a controversial document, the Instrument of Accession, on 26 October 1947 with the Maharaja of Kashmir, in which the Maharaja obtained India's military help against popular insurgency. The people of Kashmir and Pakistan do not accept the Indian claim. There are doubts about the very existence of the Instrument of Accession.

The United Nations also does not consider Indian claim as legally valid: it recognizes Kashmir as a disputed territory. With the exception of India, the entire world community recognizes Kashmir as a disputed territory. The fact is that all the principles on the basis of which the Indian subcontinent was partitioned by the British in 1947 justify Kashmir becoming a part of Pakistan: the State had majority Muslim population, and it not only enjoyed geographical proximity with Pakistan but also had essential economic linkages with the territories constituting Pakistan. The State of Jammu and Kashmir has historically remained independent, except in the anarchical conditions of the late 18th and first half of the 19th century, or when incorporated in the vast empires set up by the Mauryas (3 rd century BC), the Mughals (16th to 18th century) and the British (mid-19th to mid-20th century). All these empires included not only present-day India and Pakistan but some other countries of the region as well.

The Indians, however, argue that the merger — although illegal — has ended the disputed nature of occupied Kashmir and therefore it should be removed from the council’s agenda. The UNSC does not recognise the Indian claim and not only treats occupied Kashmir as an unresolved dispute but also maintains military observers on both sides of the Line of Control (LoC). Every year, the council puts occupied Kashmir on its agenda as “the India-Pakistan Question”, making it clear that it sees it as a territory disputed between the two countries. Diplomatic sources at the UN headquarters in New York told Dawn that India has long sought to remove the “India-Pakistan Question” from the agenda of the Security Council.

The Security Council, as a primary organ of the United Nations, is entrusted with the responsibility of maintaining international peace and security, which requires it to keep a list of items on its agenda. No item can be removed from the agenda if even one UN member state requests it’s retention. Pakistan annually requests retention of the agenda item called “the India-Pakistan Question” under which the Jammu and Kashmir issue has been discussed since 1948. The item was first inscribed on the agenda of the Security Council in its formal meeting on Jan 20, 1948 and since then the council has adopted 16 resolutions on Jammu and Kashmir.

15,"Illegal drug, border crossings, and human smuggling activities have decreased in areas where barriers are deployed in the United States.","What are the statistical trends and data on illegal drug, border crossings, and human smuggling activities in areas with and without barriers in the United States over a specific period?		
Mr Trump has claimed in the past that 90% of heroin in the US comes across the southern border and that a wall would help the fight against drugs. However strengthening and extending the border barrier is unlikely to do much to reduce illegal drugs - such as heroin, cocaine and methamphetamine - because most come through established border checkpoints, known as ports of entry. While the majority of the heroin in the US does come from Mexico, the Drug Enforcement Administration says most of it is hidden in privately owned vehicles or transporter lorries, mixed with other goods, and smuggled through legal entry points. CBP figures for drugs - excluding marijuana - seized on the southern border also show most come through ports of entry, although a report by the Congressional Research Service does state that border barriers can serve to push people to cross in places where they are more likely to be ""detected, intercepted, and detained"".
		

What are the statistical trends and data on illegal drug, border crossings, and human smuggling activities in areas with and without barriers in the United States over a specific period?		
Rodney Scott, chief of the US Border Patrol, agrees - and gives the example of San Diego, where he says cartel lorries used to drive across the border ""three or four at a time on an almost daily basis, with high-speed pursuits throughout town"". ""Those stopped immediately with the border wall system, "" he says. ""It does not mean cartels will stop smuggling drugs - now we're going to deal with tunnels and other aspects - but it pushed that threat, the daily life-and-death threat for kids waiting for a school bus near the border, out of those areas."" Smugglers also appear increasingly to be using boats to try to land drugs on the beaches of southern California - with the numbers intercepted by CBP's air and marine operations jumping 82% last year. Marijuana is the most trafficked drug, with more than 227 tonnes seized on the southern border this year.

Mr Trump made reducing illegal immigration a top priority of his administration and it has been a key part of his re-election campaign. The latest figures suggest the number of migrants apprehended at the southern border this year have fallen after doubling between 2018 and 2019. In particular, the number of children and those travelling in family groups apprehended at the border has dropped significantly in the 12 months to October, compared with the previous year. How much this fall in numbers is down to the new barriers is unclear, though, and immigration experts say the drop is likely to be the result of the deterrent effect of a whole raft of anti-immigration measures introduced by Mr Trump's administration rather than the barrier alone.

Under Trump, the military has installed 70 miles of concertina wire. Separately, border authorities have worked on improving existing structures. Only one of those projects, the Calexico border effort in California, started and finished under Trump. Also, while Trump says that border fencing has been ""very effective,"" he doesn't mention that illegal border crossings are actually back on the rise. According to U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials, there were nearly 397,000 people arrested trying to illegally cross the U.S.-Mexico border in the 2018 budget year.

But although figures for detentions at the border are likely to have dropped for the year as a whole compared with 2019, monthly figures have been rising since the spring and reached a 13-month high in September. This is driven partly by single adults from Mexico who have been trying to enter the US repeatedly, according to CBP figures. Data shows the ""recidivism rate"" - the number of repeat crossers - has risen by 37% since the end of March.

Indirect evidence consistently supports the use of surgical masks Most of the research comparing the protective effect of surgical masks with respirator masks has been generated from influenza or other relatively benign respiratory diseases. To date, there are no published head-to-head studies in COVID-19. The current guidelines are therefore extrapolated from influenza and previous outbreaks of SARS-1 and MERS, and on expert opinion [12, 44]. Despite the documentation of infectious influenza aerosols in clinical samples [24], evidence of aerosol transmission in clinical practice has neither been found for influenza nor for SARS.

What are the key studies or sources cited as evidence for the claim that masks do not meaningfully help with the aerosol transmission of COVID-19, and what is the consensus in the scientific community regarding their effectiveness?		
- Cloth masks or coverings come in a variety of shapes, sizes, and materials and are not made according to any standards. - Transmission is not simply a function of short random interactions between individuals, but rather a function of particle concentration in the air and the time exposed to that concentration. - A cloth mask or face covering does very little to prevent the emission or inhalation of small particles. As discussed in an earlier CIDRAP commentary and more recently by Morawska and Milton (2020) in an open letter to WHO signed by 239 scientists, inhalation of small infectious particles is not only biologically plausible, but the epidemiology supports it as an important mode of transmission for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.

Everyone wore a mask and none of the clients tested positive. Do masks protect the people wearing them or the people around them? “I think there’s enough evidence to say that the best benefit is for people who have COVID-19 to protect them from giving COVID-19 to other people, but you’re still going to get a benefit from wearing a mask if you don’t have COVID-19,” said Chin-Hong. Masks may be more effective as a “source control” because they can prevent larger expelled droplets from evaporating into smaller droplets that can travel farther.

What are the key studies or sources cited as evidence for the claim that masks do not meaningfully help with the aerosol transmission of COVID-19, and what is the consensus in the scientific community regarding their effectiveness?		
An international team of researchers published an analysis of the effects of social distancing, masks and other measures on COVID-19 on June 1 in The Lancet. Both scientists said the evidence has become even more powerful for wearing masks and social distancing. For instance, research shows that about 30 percent of infections are caused by people who do not know they have COVID-19 because they are asymptomatic or their symptoms have not appeared yet. “So we don’t know who might spread it,” Blumberg said. “We do know social distancing reduces the risk of transmitting the virus by 90 percent, and wearing masks decreases the risk by 65 percent.
		

What are the key studies or sources cited as evidence for the claim that masks do not meaningfully help with the aerosol transmission of COVID-19, and what is the consensus in the scientific community regarding their effectiveness?		
As noted in a previous commentary, the limited data we have for COVID-19 strongly support the possibility that SARS-CoV-2—the virus that causes COVID-19—is transmitted by inhalation of both droplets and aerosols near the source. It is also likely that people who are pre-symptomatic or asymptomatic throughout the duration of their infection are spreading the disease in this way. We do not recommend requiring the general public who do not have symptoms of COVID-19-like illness to routinely wear cloth or surgical masks because: - There is no scientific evidence they are effective in reducing the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission
		

What are the key studies or sources cited as evidence for the claim that masks do not meaningfully help with the aerosol transmission of COVID-19, and what is the consensus in the scientific community regarding their effectiveness?		
In summary, though we support mask wearing by the general public, we continue to conclude that cloth masks and face coverings are likely to have limited impact on lowering COVID-19 transmission, because they have minimal ability to prevent the emission of small particles, offer limited personal protection with respect to small particle inhalation, and should not be recommended as a replacement for physical distancing or reducing time in enclosed spaces with many potentially infectious people. We are very concerned about messaging that suggests cloth masks or face coverings can replace physical distancing. We also worry that the public doesn't understand the limitations of cloth masks and face coverings when we observe how many people wear their mask under their nose or even under their mouth, remove their masks when talking to someone nearby, or fail to practice physical distancing when wearing a mask.

What are the key studies or sources cited as evidence for the claim that masks do not meaningfully help with the aerosol transmission of COVID-19, and what is the consensus in the scientific community regarding their effectiveness?		
One category of evidence comes from laboratory studies of respiratory droplets and the ability of various masks to block them. An experiment using high-speed video found that hundreds of droplets ranging from 20 to 500 micrometers were generated when saying a simple phrase, but that nearly all these droplets were blocked when the mouth was covered by a damp washcloth. Another study of people who had influenza or the common cold found that wearing a surgical mask significantly reduced the amount of these respiratory viruses emitted in droplets and aerosols. But the strongest evidence in favor of masks come from studies of real-world scenarios. “The most important thing are the epidemiologic data,” said Rutherford.

Some states that expanded vote by mail did so by extending deadlines for postmarked ballots. Other states did so by ordering that every voter receive a mail-in ballot. California Governor Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, issued an executive order in May 2020 ordering that all of California’s registered voters get vote-by-mail ballots for the November 3, 2020, general election.
		

What are the specific laws or regulations regarding the acceptance of mail-in ballots postmarked by Election Day in the relevant jurisdiction, and do they allow for ballots received after Election Day to be counted if postmarked on or before Election Day?		
Thorley said, based on the law, election officials would count a ballot that bore no postmark if it were received within three days of the election. “But again that would be the rare exception,” Thorley said. “If your plan is to wait until the day after the election to vote, then I can say with almost 100 percent certainty your ballot won’t be counted.” Jessica A. Levinson, a professor who specializes in election law at Loyola Law School in California, agreed. “Theoretically, a voter could vote the morning after Election Day, put it in the mail and pray for an ineligible postmark and quick delivery,” Levinson told us via email.
		

What are the specific laws or regulations regarding the acceptance of mail-in ballots postmarked by Election Day in the relevant jurisdiction, and do they allow for ballots received after Election Day to be counted if postmarked on or before Election Day?		
Michigan will start processing mail-in ballots — taking them out of their envelopes, marking names off the voter list, and more — the day before the election and will feed them into vote-scanning machines on Election Day. Another factor is whether states count absentee ballots that are postmarked by Election Day but arrive later. In 2016 in Washington, which uses entirely mail-in ballots, 31.3 percent of votes were counted after Election Day. In Oregon, which also is a vote-by-mail state, that figure was just 6.0 percent. Why? Washington allows ballots to be counted if they are received five days after Election Day, while in Oregon, ballots must be received by Election Day.

23,Joe Biden wants to ban fracking,"Has Joe Biden publicly stated or proposed specific legislation or executive actions to ban fracking during his presidency?		
Biden's written plan never included a full ban on fracking; rather, it proposes ""banning new oil and gas permitting on public lands and waters,"" not ending all new fracking anywhere or ending all existing fracking on public lands and waters. Biden has explicitly said he does not support a nationwide fracking ban (though in part because he doesn't believe such a ban would pass). Biden created confusion about his stance with some of his comments during the Democratic primary. For example, he had this exchange with CNN's Dana Bash during a July 2019 debate: Bash: ""Thank you, Mr. Vice President. Just to clarify, would there be any place for fossil fuels, including coal and fracking, in a Biden administration?""
		

Has Joe Biden publicly stated or proposed specific legislation or executive actions to ban fracking during his presidency?		
“I do rule out banning fracking because we need other industries to transition to only net-zero emissions,” Biden said. “What I will do with fracking over time is make sure we can capture the emissions from fracking, capture the emissions from gas.” “I would transition from the oil industry, yes,” Biden said later. “It’s a big statement because the oil industry pollutes significantly. … It has to be replaced by renewable energy over time.”
		

Has Joe Biden publicly stated or proposed specific legislation or executive actions to ban fracking during his presidency?		
Biden’s written plan proposes “banning new oil and gas permitting on public lands and waters” and he’s pledged to “establish an enforcement mechanism to achieve net-zero emissions no later than 2050,” which would almost certainly require a significant reduction in oil and gas production. Biden is not running on a proposal to completely ban fracking (hydraulic fracturing, a drilling method used to extract natural gas or oil). In fact, he explicitly said last week, “I am not banning fracking.” However, there is at least some basis for Trump’s claim: During the Democratic primaries, Biden sometimes suggested he was proposing to get rid of all fracking.

Vice President Mike Pence claimed during tonight's debate that the Biden campaign wants to “ban fracking.” Facts First: This is misleading.

However, there is at least some basis for Pence’s claim: During the Democratic primary, Biden sometimes suggested he was proposing to get rid of all fracking.

Has Joe Biden publicly stated or proposed specific legislation or executive actions to ban fracking during his presidency?		
Fact Check: Joe Biden wants to eliminate new fracking permits, not all fracking The claim that presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden wants to eliminate fracking has been made for much of the presidential campaign. This summer, it was made in a post on Facebook and is similar to an ad by America First Action, a pro-Trump Political Action Committee. It includes a video of Biden answering a question in a primary debate and a claim that Biden could cost Pennsylvania more than 600,000 jobs.
		

Has Joe Biden publicly stated or proposed specific legislation or executive actions to ban fracking during his presidency?		
Biden also said he was against “new fracking” in a Democratic primary debate in March when challenged by his opponent, Sen. Bernie Sanders, on the issue of climate change. His campaign clarified to reporters that same evening that Biden was reiterating his plan to ban oil and gas permits on public land, not a complete ban on new fracking, which a president cannot do. Without an act of Congress, the President could not issue an outright ban on fracking across the US. There are, however, a number of regulatory and executive actions an administration could take to prevent or shrink the use of fracking technology, particularly on federal land. The problem is that most fracking takes place on private land, and any attempts to limit it would likely face legal challenges.

Fact-checking Joe Biden in Pennsylvania on his fracking policy Biden wants to block the federal government from issuing new permits for drilling on public lands but would allow existing fracking operations to continue. Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden appeared Monday in Pittsburgh and defended his position on hydraulic fracturing, or fracking — a controversial drilling technique that has lifted the economy in Western Pennsylvania. “I am not banning fracking.

A Biden campaign spokesman clarified afterward that Biden wouldn’t ban fracking — he was referring only to his stated policy to ban new permits for oil and gas drilling on federal land and offshore, the Wall Street Journal reported. A Facebook post says Biden ""just announced on CNN he will completely shut down drilling for oil and natural gas on day one of his administration.""
		

Has Joe Biden publicly stated or proposed specific legislation or executive actions to ban fracking during his presidency?		
Former Vice President Joe Biden claimed that he “never said I oppose fracking” when pressed by President Donald Trump on the issue during Thursday night’s presidential debate. Facts First: It’s false that Biden never said he opposed fracking. In two Democratic primary debates, Biden made confusing remarks over fracking that his campaign had to clarify. In 2019, Biden said “we would make sure it’s eliminated” when asked about the future of coal and fracking; in 2020 he said he opposed “new fracking.” Biden’s written plan, conversely, never included a full ban on fracking or even on new fracking. Rather, it proposes “banning new oil and gas permitting on public lands and waters” – not ending all new fracking anywhere or ending all existing fracking on public lands and waters.
		

Has Joe Biden publicly stated or proposed specific legislation or executive actions to ban fracking during his presidency?		
Biden’s remarks came after Trump, speaking Thursday on the final night of the Republican National Convention, accused him of wanting to “abolish” natural gas production in the United States. Fracking is used to extract natural gas from reservoirs deep beneath the Earth’s surface. We’ve examined Biden’s position on fracking before, so we know he has not called for banning the practice. He wants to block the federal government from issuing new permits for drilling on public lands but would allow existing fracking operations to continue.

German foreign minister Heiko Maas has warned the King not to govern from German soil.[63] He also mentioned that the European state will be investigating his behavior during his stay in Germany.[64] On 26 October 2020, protesters marched to the German Embassy in Bangkok, petitioning the German government to investigate the King's activities in Germany for the possibility that he had been exercising powers from German soil.[33][65][66] Vajiralongkorn is protected by one of the most strictly enforced lèse majesté laws in the world. For many years, criticism of the king, queen, crown prince, and more recently, former kings, members of the royal family, and even their pets[67] have been strictly prohibited. Violations carry large fines and prison sentences of up to 35 years. However, Vajiralongkorn's private life continues to be a controversial subject of discussion in Thailand, although not publicly.

On Monday in Berlin, Maas spoke again, telling reporters the government was following developments in Thailand and was aware of the demonstrations and “people taking to the streets for their rights.” He added that he also was watching the king’s activities in Germany. “We have been examining this not only in recent weeks, but we are continuing to examine it in the long term, and if there are things we feel to be unlawful, then that will have immediate consequences,” Maas said. Vajiralongkorn has for years spent significant time in Germany, but it only became an issue after the death of his father, King Bhumibol Adulyadej, in 2016.

“Conducting official state affairs in Thailand while living in Germany is not permissible,” he told This Week Schmidt, a member of parliament’s foreign policy committee and an expert on Southeast Asian issues, raised his complaints to Maas, the foreign minister, in a memorable encounter in parliament last week. He said that it was all fine and good that the Thai king was a resident of Germany, owning a villa in the town of Tutzing overlooking the picturesque Starnberg Lake. But he nevertheless wanted to know: “Why has the German government been tolerating, for many months, this extremely unusual and, in my opinion, illegal behaviour in Germany by a foreign head of state?”

(nd) Responding to a question in the parliament, German Foreign minister Heiko Maas said Thailand’s King Maha Vajiralongkorn should not be conducting politics from Germany, where he resides part of the year. Currently, King Vajiralongkorn and Thai monarchy in general face unprecedented calls for reform from thousands of protesters, holding demonstrations for the last months. Protesters are calling for reforms of the monarchy and removal of Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha, and a new constitution. After the 2014-coup, which put the current PM in power, the EU halted contacts at all levels with Thailand, but resumed trade talks after the general election last year.

Maas pledged to investigate and said the German government was already fully “aware of the many bizarre reports about what is happening there” in Bavaria with the Thai king. He added: “But it does not correspond with the views of the German government that guests of our country are conducting business in their home countries. We would clearly not stand for that. We have made it clear that policies concerning Thailand should not be conducted on German soil.” “The comments from Foreign Minister Maas were an important first step but that needs to be followed up with further actions,” said Schmidt, adding that his goal in bringing up the matter was to “stand up for our values and support democracy”.

For years, Thai king Maha Vajiralongkorn (68), also known as Rama X, has been ruling his people at will from a luxury hotel in Garmisch. This could soon be over. On Wednesday, Greens Member of Parliament Frithjof Schmidt (67) wanted to know from Foreign Minister Heiko Maas (54, SPD): why does the government tolerate the Thai king conducting his policies from German soil?

In 2017, the year the law on crown property assets was passed, the king combined the former royal household office with the privy council and a royal personal safety body to create a single Royal Office.

Over the past month, violence has flared up between the neighbouring Caucus nations of Azerbaijan and Armenia over the long-disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh, an Armenian-controlled enclave which is internationally recognised as part of Azerbaijan. Each side blames the other for the sudden clashes, with Armenia claiming that its neighbour launched air and artillery attacks on the territory on the morning of September 27. For its part, Azerbaijan insists it was conducting a ""counter-offensive in response to military provocation"". As fighting turned deadly, Armenia declared martial law and general mobilisation, while Azerbaijan announced a state of war in some regions.

This seemingly regional dispute threatens to bring in other major powers, with Russia backing Armenia and Turkey supporting Azerbaijan. Turkey and Armenia have no diplomatic relations, due to the larger nation refusing to recognise the 1915 Armenian genocide, which saw an estimated 1.5 million people killed, a figure the Turkish government disputes. The Nagorno-Karabakh region is also vital to the global energy trade. Oil and natural gas pipelines connecting Azerbaijan and Turkey are crucial for the European Union's energy supply.

26,Ivermectin is a treatment for coronavirus.,"Has any reputable health organization, such as the World Health Organization (WHO) or the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), officially endorsed the use of Ivermectin as an effective treatment for COVID-19?		
In some unpublished reports in other countries (e.g., Egypt, India, Iran, Iraq) Ivermectin seemed to improve outcomes for COVID-19 patients, but these were not scientific studies. Multiple studies published on Ivermectin have been subsequently retracted when they were found to be based on falsified data or errors in analysis and are misleading. Adequate clinical trials have not been done to prove ivermectin is effective to treat or prevent COVID-19. There is not enough evidence to recommend ivermectin as a COVID-19 treatment at this time. Clinical trials to evaluate the effectiveness of Ivermectin as a COVID treatment are ongoing.
		

Has any reputable health organization, such as the World Health Organization (WHO) or the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), officially endorsed the use of Ivermectin as an effective treatment for COVID-19?		
Ivermectin is not approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat or prevent COVID-19. The FDA has issued a warning statementabout the dangers of taking this drug in large doses or for unapproved uses. And it is not safe for humans to take medications meant for animals. (Ivermectin prescribed for animals is very different than ivermectin prescribed for humans.) Do not take any prescription drug, including ivermectin, unless your doctor recommends that you do so.
		

Has any reputable health organization, such as the World Health Organization (WHO) or the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), officially endorsed the use of Ivermectin as an effective treatment for COVID-19?		
The Antiviral Research pre-publication paper, “The FDA-approved drug ivermectin inhibits the replication of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro” documents how SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) responded to ivermectin when exposed in a petri dish. Ivermectin is FDA-approved for use in animals for prevention of heartworm disease in some small animal species, and for treatment of certain internal and external parasites in various animal species. - People should never take animal drugs, as the FDA has only evaluated their safety and effectiveness in the particular animal species for which they are labeled. These animal drugs can cause serious harm in people.

This medication is used to treat certain parasitic roundworm infections. Curing parasitic infections helps to improve your quality of life. In people with weakened defense (immune) systems, curing roundworm infections can reduce the risk of developing a severe or life-threatening infection. Ivermectin belongs to a class of drugs known as antihelmintics. It works by paralyzing and killing parasites. Ivermectin is not recommended for coronavirus disease, also known as COVID-19, unless you are enrolled in a study.

After adjustment for between-group differences and mortality risks, the mortality difference remained significant for the entire cohort (OR 0.27, CI 0.09-0.85, p=.03; HR 0.37, CI 0.19-0.71, p=.03). Conclusions and Relevance Ivermectin was associated with lower mortality during treatment of COVID-19, especially in patients who required higher inspired oxygen or ventilatory support. These findings should be further evaluated with randomized controlled trials. I confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.

But this does not mean the same drugs are safe when used to treat Covid, especially since many patients have weakened immune systems and co-morbidities. Most completed studies into ivermectin as a stand-alone or combination treatment to treat the virus have been done only in test tubes or in animals. Completed studies of its effect on people with the virus are small, have not been designed or reviewed in a way to be sure of efficacy. In some studies it’s too difficult to tease out the effect of the drug in isolation from other interventions.

Importance No therapy to date has been shown to improve survival for patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. Ivermectin has been shown to inhibit the replication of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro but clinical response has not been previously evaluated.

A world-leading parasite researcher has warned there could be serious consequences for Australia if the drug ivermectin were to be used widely in the treatment of Covid-19, saying “there is no strong, robust evidence that ivermectin provides benefits against the disease”. Dr Carlos Chaccour, from the Barcelona Institute of Global Health, has been studying ivermectin for more than a decade and spoke after reports the anti-parasitic drug could treat Covid-19. On Tuesday the National party MP David Gillespie called for ivermectin to be used off-label – that is, for conditions for which it has not been approved by regulators – to treat the virus. It is the latest in a line of medicines being promoted by some commentators as “safe” and “approved” because drugs regulators such as the Therapeutic Goods Administration in Australia and the Food and Drug Administration in the United States have said they are safe for treating certain well known and studied conditions.
		

Has any reputable health organization, such as the World Health Organization (WHO) or the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), officially endorsed the use of Ivermectin as an effective treatment for COVID-19?		
The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved the use of either hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) or ivermectin for treating or preventing COVID-19 in humans. Both drugs are FDA approved for other diseases and can be taken safely as directed by a doctor. Neither drug is an anti-viral medication. In South Carolina, there has been an increase in people needing care in an emergency department for ivermectin and HCQ exposure in 2021.

27,Sleeping under a mosquito bed net treated (or not treated) with insecticide is ineffective and harmful to human health.,"What is the scientific evidence or research supporting the claim that sleeping under an insecticide-treated or untreated mosquito bed net is ineffective and harmful to human health?		
A bed net is a net that hangs above a sleeping space, usually a bed or matt, and provides a physical barrier between the malaria-carrying mosquito and the person at risk of getting the disease. An insecticide-treated bed net protects the person sleeping under the net even if the net has small holes in it, because the insecticide kills mosquitoes that do get through the net before they reach the sleeping person. Since insecticide-treated nets kill the mosquitoes, they help reduce malaria transmission community-wide (if there is high use of insecticide-treated nets in the community). Even where insecticide-treated nets have been recommended for all children under 5 years, most children do not sleep under a bed net.
		

What is the scientific evidence or research supporting the claim that sleeping under an insecticide-treated or untreated mosquito bed net is ineffective and harmful to human health?		
This article was published in Scientific American’s former blog network and reflects the views of the author, not necessarily those of Scientific American One of the most effective methods for the control of spread of malaria is the use of bed nets infused with insecticides. Most species of mosquitoes (the Anopheles genus) that carry the malarial parasite (Plasmodium falciparum) are considered to be strictly nocturnal - they are active only during the night. Thus, sleeping under the net provides protection against getting bitten by the insect vectors of the disease.

Mass use of insecticide-treated bednets in malaria endemic poor countries: public health concerns and remedies Mass use of insecticide-treated bednets in malaria endemic poor countries: public health concerns and remedies Epidemiological evidence arising mainly from studies undertaken in sub-Saharan Africa suggests that sleeping under insecticide-treated mosquito nets is a cost-effective and efficacious method of controlling malaria. For this reason, promotion of use of insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) has become a key malaria control strategy.
		

What is the scientific evidence or research supporting the claim that sleeping under an insecticide-treated or untreated mosquito bed net is ineffective and harmful to human health?		
Insecticide-treated bed nets (ITNs) are a form of personal protection that has been shown to reduce malaria illness, severe disease, and death due to malaria in endemic regions. In community-wide trials in several African settings, ITNs were shown to reduce the death of children under 5 years from all causes by about 20%. Bed nets form a protective barrier around people sleeping under them. However, bed nets treated with an insecticide are much more protective than untreated nets. The insecticides that are used for treating bed nets kill mosquitoes, as well as other insects. The insecticides also repel mosquitoes, reducing the number that enter the house and attempt to feed on people inside.
		

What is the scientific evidence or research supporting the claim that sleeping under an insecticide-treated or untreated mosquito bed net is ineffective and harmful to human health?		
About 20% of participants also spoke about the sound sleep derived from sleeping under an ITN. This was credited to the ability of ITNs to serve as a barrier to the buzzing noise made by mosquitoes at night. …the treated net protects the pregnant women mbecause [sic] if you don’t sleep in it and you get mosquito bites, it will infect the unborn child in the womb with malaria. 3.3. Factors Affecting the Use of Insecticide-Treated Bed Nets The respondents gave different reasons why some pregnant women do not sleep under ITNs every night. These reasons were categorized under four themes: access/mode of acquisition, discomfort, and logistical constraints.
		

What is the scientific evidence or research supporting the claim that sleeping under an insecticide-treated or untreated mosquito bed net is ineffective and harmful to human health?		
The respondents who owned mosquito nets indicated several reasons why they were sleeping under them, among which 140 (88.61%) claimed to sleep under the mosquito net in order to protect themselves, 16 (10.13%) were protecting themselves and children, 2 (1.3%) were protecting their children, and 2 (1.3%) were sleeping under the net to avoid malaria. 3.7. Other Control Measures Used by Pregnant Women Having Nets Over 83% of those who were having mosquito bed nets relied on it to fight against malaria. However, 10% used insecticide as another control measure and 7% burnt organic materials. 3.8. Overall Prevalence of Malaria among Pregnant Women
		

What is the scientific evidence or research supporting the claim that sleeping under an insecticide-treated or untreated mosquito bed net is ineffective and harmful to human health?		
- Children sleeping under the new bed nets were 52 per cent less likely to be moderately anaemic than those with a conventional net. Malaria anaemia is a major cause of mortality in children under two years old. - In areas with the new combination bed nets, there was a 51 per cent reduction in risk of a malaria-infective mosquito bite compared to areas with conventional nets. Blood-seeking malaria mosquitoes (female Anopheles mosquitoes) are increasingly becoming resistant to the most common insecticides, called pyrethroids, used to treat traditional bed nets.
		

What is the scientific evidence or research supporting the claim that sleeping under an insecticide-treated or untreated mosquito bed net is ineffective and harmful to human health?		
ITNs protect people sleeping under them and simultaneously kill mosquitoes that contact the nets. Some protection is provided to others by this method, including people sleeping in the same room but not under the net. However, mathematical modeling has suggested that disease transmission may be exacerbated after bed nets have lost their insecticidal properties under certain circumstances.[25] Although ITN users are still protected by the physical barrier of the netting, non-users could experience an increased bite rate as mosquitoes are deflected away from the non-lethal bed net users.[25] The modeling suggests that this could increase transmission when the human population density is high or at lower human densities when mosquitoes are more adept at locating their blood meals.[25]
		

What is the scientific evidence or research supporting the claim that sleeping under an insecticide-treated or untreated mosquito bed net is ineffective and harmful to human health?		
Sleeping under Insecticide-treated Nets to Prevent Malaria in Nigeria: What Do We Know? Malaria remains a public-health concern in Nigeria despite huge global investments in the production and distribution of insecticide-treated bednets (ITNs) to protect people from Plasmodium falciparum parasite. Information on the use of ITNs is needed for designing strategies for its effective use. Focus group discussions (FGDs) were conducted in communities from 3 geopolitical zones of Nigeria. The people had poor knowledge of malaria and mosquito bites, which resulted in wrong perception and misuse of the nets as door and window blinds to “protect entire household” since only two nets were given per household.
		

What is the scientific evidence or research supporting the claim that sleeping under an insecticide-treated or untreated mosquito bed net is ineffective and harmful to human health?		
Moreover, these doubly treated, or “combination”, nets are more expensive and so it can be hard for health officials to decide whether and where to use them. Now, Churcher et al. have used computer modeling to help predict how insecticide resistance might change malaria infection rates and help determine when it makes sense to switch to the combination net. Insecticide-treated bednets provide good protection for individuals sleeping under them until relatively high levels of resistance are achieved, as measured using a simple test. As more resistant mosquitos survive encounters with the nets, the likelihood of being bitten before bed or while sleeping unprotected by a net increases.

If Irani betrayed her lack of knowledge of how different communities in India have alternative readings of the Durga-Mahishasura myth, this is not the first time her party has been wrong-footed by its understanding of the Hindu goddess. In 2006, BJP MP Vijay Kumar Malhotra attacked the UPA government in the Lok Sabha for “insulting” Durga in an MA textbook used by IGNOU by saying she drank alcohol. Responding on behalf of the UPA, Pranab Mukherjee pointed out that the statement was not wrong.” The Indian Express reported: He then proceeded to read out Sanskrit stanzas from the third chapter (adhyaya) of the Sri Durga Saptashati — famous in Bengal as the Chandi Path — on the battle between Goddess Durga and the demon Mahishasura.

New Delhi: In her Lok Sabha speech on Wednesday, HRD minister Smriti Irani responded to criticism of the government’s handling of recent events in JNU by alleging that several “anti-national” events had taken place at the campus. The celebration of ‘Mahishasur Martyrdom Day’ featured on this list. Asking her “god to forgive” her, she read from a pamphlet allegedly brought out by the organisers of the event: “Durga Puja is the most controversial racial festival, where a fair skinned beautiful goddess Durga is depicted brutally killing a dark-skinned native called Mahishasura. Mahishasura, a brave self-respecting leader, was tricked into marriage by the Aryans. They hired a sex worker called Durga, who enticed Mahishasura into marriage and killed him after nine nights of honeymooning, during sleep”.

This is nothing new. If she is so against this ‘demon’, she should ask the ASI why it protect monuments in his honour”. The office of the Forward Press magazine was raided by the police a few days before the event. Their October 2014 issue contained a reading of the Durga and Mahishasura story from “a Bahujan perspective”. All copies of the issue were confiscated, and four members of its staff were detained. This happened after two ABVP students from JNU claimed that the issue portrayed Durga in a bad light, and “created caste tensions”. The paintings of Lal Ratnakar, a Santhal painter, were also seen as offensive and hurtful to sentiments.

There was no need, he agreed, to incorporate these facts in college textbooks but to question the authenticity of the scriptures smacked of ignorance. “When Ma Durga was offered all the equipment for battle by different gods, the last was a drinking vessel given to her by Kubera. In our part of the world, even a schoolchild knows this. I don’t know why these people are making such a fuss,” he added. The irony is that in 2016, the BJP continues to consider deviations from its own reading of the Durga legend to be unacceptable while the Congress, instead of urging respect for India’s diverse traditions, is accusing Irani of blasphemy for having quoted from what is purported to be the ‘Mahishasura Martyrdom Day’ pamphlet from JNU.

[to do so]. But at the same time, why must you show Mahishasura dying? That is hurtful to those, especially marginalised sections, who have a different view of the story”. One of those who spoke at the “anti-national” event was BJP MP Udit Raj. Why he attended and what he thought of Irani’s attack on ‘Mahihasur Martyrdom Day’ is not clear; Raj was not available when The Wire tried to reach him for his comment. Anil also added that the allegations Irani made in parliament were not to be taken at face value. “What Irani said was totally fabricated. The things she said we wrote in our pamphlet were in fact from an ABVP pamphlet, where they claimed to be quoting what we had said.

The shlokas describe how the goddess drank once, and then again and again, in the midst of battle, her eyes bloodshot — as red as the rays of the rising sun. His intervention did not go down well with the BJP benches although no saffron MP could counter the scripture or question its authenticity. They continued shouting about the UPA government’s disregard for religious sentiments and the House was adjourned. The BJP’s charge cut little ice with Mukherjee who comes from a family of priests. “If these people do not know their religious scriptures, it is not my fault,” Mukherjee told this reporter later.

“What is this depraved mentality?” Irani asked the house after she finished reading. “I have no answer for it”. The event in question was held in JNU on October 9, 2014 by the All India Backward Students’ Forum (AIBSF). Anil, a JNU student and member of AIBSA who was one of the organisers, spoke to The Wire about the intent of the event. “We were celebrating Mahishasura Martyrdom Day because he is an icon for the adivasis and other marginalised people in India”, he said.

“Mahishasura was portrayed as a Yadav king, and the complaint from the RSS’s supporters argued that we were creating divisions between Yadavs and Brahmins”, consulting editor at Forward Press Pramod Ranjan told The Wire. “There is no one Hindu narrative. The Hindu religion encompasses lots of different people and traditions. What people like Smriti Irani are trying to is push a Brahminical narrative that promotes inequalities”, Ranjan said. “We are trying to put forward the voices that aren’t heard, the voices people aren’t willing to hear”.

The Asur tribe is classified as a ‘particularly vulnerable tribal group’ by the Indian government. “The aim was not to have some sort of new prayer meeting”, he added. “It was to try and understand contemporary society and why it is a certain way. It was looking at literature and history, and the transfer of societal values. We are not saying that nobody should worship Durga, it is the people’s right

Calling Trump “a rookie candidate — a potential superstar of vast promise, but making rookie mistakes,” the Post insists that “the promise is there” and fawns over Trump’s “drawing millions of new voters to the polls and inspiring people who’d given up on ever again having a candidate who’d fight for them.” The endorsement plays up the billionaire Manhattan real-estate magnate’s New York values, characterizing him as a “plain-talking entrepreneur with outer-borough, common-sense sensibilities” who “offers hope” to “those who’ve seen their government ignore their needs.” About those rookie mistakes; the Post assumes Trump will “pivot — not just on the issues, but in his manner,” in a general-election campaign.

33,"America went from 75,000 flu deaths last year in 2019 to almost 0 in 2020","What was the official number of flu-related deaths reported in the United States for the year 2020, and how did public health measures during the COVID-19 pandemic potentially impact these numbers?		
On average, the CDC estimates of deaths attributed to influenza were nearly 6 times greater than its reported counted numbers. Conversely, COVID-19 fatalities are at present being counted and reported directly, not estimated. As a result, the more valid comparison would be to compare weekly counts of COVID-19 deaths to weekly counts of seasonal influenza deaths. During the week ending April 21, 2020, 15 455 COVID-19 counted deaths were reported in the US.5 The reported number of counted deaths from the previous week, ending April 14, was 14 478. By contrast, according to the CDC, counted deaths during the peak week of the influenza seasons from 2013-2014 to 2019-2020 ranged from 351 (2015-2016, week 11 of 2016) to 1626 (2017-2018, week 3 of 2018).6
		

What was the official number of flu-related deaths reported in the United States for the year 2020, and how did public health measures during the COVID-19 pandemic potentially impact these numbers?		
The mean number of counted deaths during the peak week of influenza seasons from 2013-2020 was 752.4 (95% CI, 558.8-946.1).7 These statistics on counted deaths suggest that the number of COVID-19 deaths for the week ending April 21 was 9.5-fold to 44.1-fold greater than the peak week of counted influenza deaths during the past 7 influenza seasons in the US, with a 20.5-fold mean increase (95% CI, 16.3-27.7).5,6 The CDC also publishes provisional counts of COVID-19 deaths but acknowledges that its reporting lags behind other public data sources.7 For the week ending April 11, 2020, data indicate that the number of provisionally reported COVID-19 deaths was 14.4-fold greater than influenza deaths during the apparent peak week of the current season (week ending February 29, 2020), consistent with the ranges based on CDC statistics.6 As the CDC continues to revise its COVID-19 counts to account for delays in reporting, the ratio of counted COVID-19 deaths to influenza deaths is likely to increase. The ratios we present are more clinically consistent with frontline conditions than ratios that compare COVID-19 fatality counts and estimated seasonal influenza deaths. Based on the figure of approximately 60 000 COVID-19 deaths in the US as of the end of April 2020, this ratio suggests only a 1.0-fold to 2.6-fold change from the CDC-estimated seasonal influenza deaths calculated during the previous 7 full seasons.3 From our analysis, we infer that either the CDC’s annual estimates substantially overstate the actual number of deaths caused by influenza or that the current number of COVID-19 counted deaths substantially understates the actual number of deaths caused by SARS-CoV-2, or both.
		

What was the official number of flu-related deaths reported in the United States for the year 2020, and how did public health measures during the COVID-19 pandemic potentially impact these numbers?		
Yet public officials continue to draw comparisons between seasonal influenza and SARS-CoV-2 mortality, often in an attempt to minimize the effects of the unfolding pandemic. The root of such incorrect comparisons may be a knowledge gap regarding how seasonal influenza and COVID-19 data are publicly reported. The CDC, like many similar disease control agencies around the world, presents seasonal influenza morbidity and mortality not as raw counts but as calculated estimates based on submitted International Classification of Diseases codes.2 Between 2013-2014 and 2018-2019, the reported yearly estimated influenza deaths ranged from 23 000 to 61 000.3 Over that same time period, however, the number of counted influenza deaths was between 3448 and 15 620 yearly.4
		

What was the official number of flu-related deaths reported in the United States for the year 2020, and how did public health measures during the COVID-19 pandemic potentially impact these numbers?		
As of early May 2020, approximately 65 000 people in the US had died of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19),1 the disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). This number appears to be similar to the estimated number of seasonal influenza deaths reported annually by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) (https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/preliminary-in-season-estimates.htm). This apparent equivalence of deaths from COVID-19 and seasonal influenza does not match frontline clinical conditions, especially in some hot zones of the pandemic where ventilators have been in short supply and many hospitals have been stretched beyond their limits. The demand on hospital resources during the COVID-19 crisis has not occurred before in the US, even during the worst of influenza seasons.

Nationally, mortality attributed to P&I peaked two times at 7.7% during the weeks ending February 23 (week 8) and March 16, 2019 (week 11). During September 30, 2018–May 18, 2019, 116 laboratory-confirmed influenza-associated pediatric deaths were reported to CDC from Chicago, New York City, and 41 states. Two deaths occurred in non-U.S. residents. Twenty-five (22%) of the deaths were associated with influenza A(H3N2) infection, 43 (37%) with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, 39 (34%) with an influenza A virus for which no subtyping was performed, eight (7%) with an influenza B virus, and one (1%) with an influenza virus for which the type was not determined. The mean age of the pediatric deaths reported this season was 6.1 years (range = 2 months–17 years); 75 (66%) children died after admission to the hospital.
		

What was the official number of flu-related deaths reported in the United States for the year 2020, and how did public health measures during the COVID-19 pandemic potentially impact these numbers?		
Using data available from October 1, 2018, to May 4, 2019, CDC estimates that influenza virus infection has caused 37.4 million–42.9 million symptomatic illnesses; 17.3 million–20.1 million medical visits; 531,000–647,000 hospitalizations; and 36,400–61,200 deaths in the United States. The 2018–19 U.S. influenza season differed from recent seasons in that there were two waves of influenza A activity of similar magnitude during the season. Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses predominated overall and represented the most frequently detected influenza A virus from October 2018 to mid-February 2019; influenza A(H3N2) viruses were reported more frequently than were A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses from late February through mid-May 2019. The predominant influenza A virus also differed by geographic region and age group. In contrast to the number of influenza A viruses reported, the number of influenza B viruses reported was low, compared with previous seasons, accounting for 4% of influenza viruses reported by public health laboratories.
		

What was the official number of flu-related deaths reported in the United States for the year 2020, and how did public health measures during the COVID-19 pandemic potentially impact these numbers?		
This is because the proportion of pneumonia deaths associated with influenza is now influenced by COVID-19-related pneumonia. The PIC percentage and the number of influenza and number of COVID-19 deaths will be presented in order to help better understand the impact of these viruses on mortality and the relative contribution of each virus to PIC mortality. The PIC percentages are compared to a seasonal baseline of P&I deaths that is calculated using a periodic regression model incorporating a robust regression procedure applied to data from the previous five years. An increase of 1.645 standard deviations above the seasonal baseline of P&I deaths is considered the “epidemic threshold,” i.e., the point at which the observed proportion of deaths attributed to pneumonia or influenza was significantly higher than would be expected at that time of the year in the absence of substantial influenza-related mortality.

What was the official number of flu-related deaths reported in the United States for the year 2020, and how did public health measures during the COVID-19 pandemic potentially impact these numbers?		
There are a number of considerations. Deaths from COVID-19 may be undercounted owing to ongoing limitations of test capacity or false-negative test results. When patients present late in the course of illness, upper respiratory tract samples are less likely to yield positive test results. Conversely, influenza counts may be less reliable because adult influenza deaths are not reportable to public health authorities, as is the case for COVID-19 deaths. Moreover, because adult influenza deaths are not reportable, epidemiologists must rely on surveillance mechanisms that attempt to account for potential underreporting.8

In 1973, a commission created by the CPP-NPA founded the National Democratic Front of the Philippines (NDF or NDFP). Attempting to unify and coordinate various leftist groups, the NDF served as an umbrella organization for the CPP-NPA and other mass revolutionary organizations. Media and academic sources have sometimes described the NDF as the CPP-NPA’s political wing, since the CPP-NPA was still illegal under Republic Act No. 1700. The CPP-NPA dominated and led the NDF. The Philippine government, among others, has used the name “CPP-NPA-NDF” or “CNN” to refer to the larger entity formed through the cooperation of the CPP-NPA and the NDF.[16]

He also pushed, ultimately without success, to create a new date for the 2020 primary election — a move that would have cost taxpayers millions of dollars just to help Republicans elect Justice Dan Kelly, a Walker appointee, to the state Supreme Court. Vos’ longtime friend, Democrat Congressman Mark Pocan, generously claimed, “Robin’s a better person than he’s putting out there right now.” Here is the majority leader of the state Senate, as quoted in the Wisconsin State Journal shortly after Democrat Tony Evers beat Walker: “I’m not sure why there’s all this discussion about [how] we’re somehow trying to undermine the new governor.

Vos could speak with such bald-faced impunity because it would take an unprecedented political wave for Republicans to lose their legislative majority come November.

Despite winning every statewide office and a majority of the statewide vote that year, Democrats managed to win only 36 of the 99 seats in the Assembly.

39,5G causes COVID-19.,"Does scientific research or evidence from credible health organizations support the claim that 5G technology causes COVID-19?		
The theory attempting to link the pandemic to 5G is senseless. The coronavirus is caused by a contagious virus, and it’s spreading in areas of the world that don’t yet have 5G technology!” Still, many ill-informed and ill-advised persons are spreading several theories linking 5G and COVID-19. So let’s drill a little deeper into this subject and separate fiction from fact. FICTION: 5G networks cause the spread of COVID-19, or symptoms of the infection.
		

Does scientific research or evidence from credible health organizations support the claim that 5G technology causes COVID-19?		
More research and experiments are needed. In any event, any health effects from 5G are NOT COVID-19. The key takeaway is that the new wireless technology is not connected to COVID-19. FACT: COVID-19 is spreading in places around the world without 5G networks. For example, there are no 5G networks at all in Iran, yet Iran has been severely affected by COVID-19. Misinformation about the health effects of 5G can be traced to a 2019 propaganda campaign promoted by Russian state television. The best way to keep yourself up on the truth about the coronavirus and other issues is to read and/or listen to information from trusted news sources – and ask questions!
		

Does scientific research or evidence from credible health organizations support the claim that 5G technology causes COVID-19?		
Since the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak in March, I have heard, as have many of you, that 5G technology fueled the pandemic and is responsible for its spread. The International Commission on Non-ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNRP) states: “Electromagnetic field (EMF) exposure from 5G devices does not cause COVID-19, nor does it have any effect on the disease process or health outcomes of those who are infected by the new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) that causes COVID-19. As described by the World Health Organization (WHO) and Centers for Disease Control (CDC), you need to come into contact physically with the coronavirus to become infected by it, and as the EMFs from 5G cannot carry viruses, they cannot bring you into contact with the virus.” The U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) also responded to the rumor saying, “5G technology does NOT cause coronavirus.
		

Does scientific research or evidence from credible health organizations support the claim that 5G technology causes COVID-19?		
In recent days there have been suspected arson attacks on mobile phone masts in Birmingham, Liverpool and Merseyside. Celebrities have pushed the idea that 5G is harmful and linked to Covid-19. The government has been forced to address the fears, with Michael Gove branding the theories “dangerous nonsense”. To be clear, these theories are wrong. As you'll see from our fact checks linked throughout this article, there's no connection between 5G and coronavirus, and no evidence of any health risk from 5G. But it's not clear that simply dismissing them is the right approach. Given the upheaval the coronavirus pandemic has caused, people are understandably worried and looking for answers.
		

Does scientific research or evidence from credible health organizations support the claim that 5G technology causes COVID-19?		
While the conspiracy theories about 5G and the coronavirus pandemic burst into public awareness at the start of April, they have been building online for months. We started seeing the link between 5G and coronavirus claims in the second half of January, shortly after the virus started getting significant UK media coverage, but before the outbreak had been declared a pandemic. But one thing that it’s important to realise is that there isn’t one single “5G conspiracy theory”. Instead, there are multiple theories, which sometimes overlap, but can also contradict each other. Look at some of the larger anti-5G groups on Facebook, and you can find these claims sitting alongside each other: that the virus is the real cause of the disease, but 5G is making it worse, that the virus is not the cause of the disease and all the symptoms are actually caused by 5G, and that there is no disease at all, and the outbreak is a gigantic hoax to enable the government to install 5G under the cover of lockdown.
		

Does scientific research or evidence from credible health organizations support the claim that 5G technology causes COVID-19?		
The post also lists 20 purported symptoms of 5G exposure, including shortness of breath and fever – symptoms similar to those of COVID-19. Full Fact and PolitiFact have engaged in extensive research to prove these claims are false. Here are the facts. FACT: A 2011 research paper suggests that bacteria may produce electromagnetic signals to communicate with other bacteria. This hypothesis is disputed, and refers in any event to bacteria and not viruses – and COVID-19 is a virus.
		

Does scientific research or evidence from credible health organizations support the claim that 5G technology causes COVID-19?		
Gregory Davis of Hope not Hate has noted that the initial reaction to the pandemic from voices on the far right teetered between outright denial and apocalypticism, and GNET Associate Fellow Eviane Leidig recently outlined that far-right activists have capitalised upon coronavirus disinformation to spread conspiratorial narratives surrounding the Chinese government and the dangers of globalism. However, as events have progressed, arguably one of the most prevalent conspiracies adopted by actors on the far right is the notion that 5G telecommunication technology, which is currently being rolled out in many countries across the globe, is the true cause of the COVID-19 illness. While there are a number of different variations to this theory, most share a belief that, even if the coronavirus is real, it is largely harmless, and the illness and death which is occurring is in fact caused by 5G. Proponents of the theory argue that the radiation from electromagnetic frequencies (EMF) generated by 5G towers, which are more powerful than those used by 4G and Wi-Fi networks, absorb oxygen in the air and from living organisms. Thus, the respiratory distress suffered by those reported as infected with COVID-19 is in fact believed to be the result of 5G radiation “beams” that are fired at people in order to deliberately kill off segments of the population.
		

Does scientific research or evidence from credible health organizations support the claim that 5G technology causes COVID-19?		
One of the first 5G and coronavirus claims we checked, that the disease had broken out in Wuhan because of 5G there, re-emerged with claims that Covid-19 hotspots were also covered by 5G, and that cases on cruise ships could be explained by the radiation emitting technology used on them. (It’s worth noting that Iran, which experienced one of the earliest severe Covid-19 outbreaks, does not have 5G.) A video from last year’s protests in Hong Kong of protesters pulling down a smart street light was used by some as a symbol of people in China “destroying the 5G poles as they are aware that it is the thing triggering the Corona syndrome.” Claims about 5G made up a relatively small amount of our work before the pandemic, but now contributes to a significant number of both the fact check requests we receive from our readers, and what we see on social media.
		

Does scientific research or evidence from credible health organizations support the claim that 5G technology causes COVID-19?		
Here’s where those 5G and coronavirus conspiracy theories came from In a now-viral video, a woman approaches two telecoms workers, asking them if they work for the NHS, and berating them when they say they don’t. Asking one of the men if he has children or parents, when she’s told he has his mum, she responds: “Well when they turn that switch on, bye-bye mama.” Suddenly, panic over 5G—the newest generation of mobile telecommunications infrastructure—and the notion that it’s the true cause of the coronavirus pandemic seems to be everywhere.
		

Does scientific research or evidence from credible health organizations support the claim that 5G technology causes COVID-19?		
Others seem to believe that because 5G hasn’t been explicitly “tested” on humans, that it shouldn’t be used. Mainstream publishers in the UK were also guilty of covering these conspiracy theories uncritically, long before the pandemic. We’ve seen claims that say there are ‘waves in 5G’ that alter and boil water, cause cancer and mental health problems, ultimately fueled by a belief that there’s no safe limit of any radiation. And this is a belief that stretches back a long way, to a time when 5G wasn’t even a twinkle in the telecoms industry’s eye.

""The end all be all is, wear a freakin' mask, protect the people around you and yourself, do not be scared off by the risk for infection,"" Friedman said.

Does wearing a face mask increase the risk of bacterial infections, such as those caused by Staphylococcus, compared to not wearing one?		
Fact check: Staph infections are common and aren't caused by face masks Since the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended the use of face masks in public in April, misinformation about the consequences of mask-wearing has spread on social media. A subset of users has falsely claimed that rather than promoting health, masks are actually a detriment to it – by weakening the immune system or causing carbon dioxide poisoning, among other assertions. The latest claim to make the rounds is that wearing face masks causes staph infections.
		

Does wearing a face mask increase the risk of bacterial infections, such as those caused by Staphylococcus, compared to not wearing one?		
Friedman agreed that masks do not cause staph infections, and are no more likely to lead to an injury or abrasion to the skin that could allow for infection. ""Anything that can abrade the top layer of the skin can facilitate the entry of bacteria,"" he said. ""It's not unique to a mask."" And those abrasions can be avoided with hygiene and skin care, like ""applying a facial moisturizer to damp skin."" ""Even if this was a real problem, there are ways to mitigate that,"" Friedman said. ""This is not an all or none.

Since masks are now considered a protective device to prevent some bacterial or viral diseases, especially COVID-19, and the advice is that we should use them to save our lives and the lives of others. It is true that masks have many benefits, but maybe they are also harmful. It seems that is possible in long- term masking, itself cause side effects or even other diseases. Therefore, since masks are now more widely used, its advantages and even disadvantages are important to us. We think, maybe there are harms that may cause other bacterial diseases as secondary bacterial infection that may be confused with COVID-19 because they may have similar symptoms or may increase the severity of it.

Does wearing a face mask increase the risk of bacterial infections, such as those caused by Staphylococcus, compared to not wearing one?		
If the public are advised to wear face masks, we must be certain that this will not adversely affect the bacterial flora of the upper respiratory tract. I am not aware of research in adults relevant to this question but there is quite extensive evidence from another field of study in which viral infection interacts with bacterial pathogens to cause sudden death [6]. In the 1980s there were approximately 1,500 deaths per annum in England and Wales from sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). This condition was associated with prone sleeping and was more common in the winter months when viral respiratory infections were prevalent in the community.
		

Does wearing a face mask increase the risk of bacterial infections, such as those caused by Staphylococcus, compared to not wearing one?		
To reduce severe disease progression or fatal outcomes, alternative methods are needed to alleviate the effects of secondary bacterial infections and eliminate bacterial pathogens while maintaining host immunity. Masks have been used more than 100 years to minimize some bacterial or viral infections [24,25]. Also, it has been showed that dual respiratory virus or bacterial-viral infections can be reduced by the use of N95 respirators [26]. In addition, masks can consider respiratory protection devices. Because they filter out fine airborne particles from reaching the respiratory system and prevent interpersonal infection, the protective effect of face mask is important After exposure to masks for hours, hot and humid environment in the facial region that covered by masks, makes discomfort such as change in physiological function of nasal cavity and hyperthermia [28].

Thin Blue Line USA, which sells the flags, says the thin blue line represents offices in the line of duty and the black represents fallen officers. Guion-Pledgure’s lawsuit said the Blue Lives Matter movement “co-opts” the Black Lives Matter movement and “repurposes it to shift focus to law enforcement — a chosen profession, not a racial identity — and thus denigrates, dilutes, and demeans the purpose of the Black Lives Matter movement.” About a month before the probation officer put up the Blue Lives Matter flag in 2017, white supremacist demonstrators displayed that same flag alongside Confederate flags during a “Unite the Right” rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, the lawsuit notes.

He said he believes Black Lives Matter is an extreme and violent organization, and he’s concerned the flags will politicize the local education system. “As for the Pride flag, it’s just perverse,” he said at a June 25 Community Engagement Committee meeting on Zoom. “I’m sorry. I’m an old timer, maybe that’s language you don’t want to hear. We need to bring up our kids in a way that doesn’t subject them to this.” Eldert-Moore said the petition leads her to believe there’s more anti-racism work to be done within the community.

Burlington High School (BHS) has become the second high school in the country to fly the Black Lives Matter flag. Nearly 1,000 students and staff participated in a brief and optional ceremony held during noninstructional time on Monday afternoon. Flown below the American Flag and Vermont’s State Flag on the school’s only flagpole, the Black Lives Matter flag is flown in honor of black history month and will remain up throughout the year. “I am incredibly proud of our students for leading this effort,” said Burlington School District Superintendent Yaw Obeng.

Coski is aware that any ambiguity about that flag is unfathomable to those who see its meaning as aggressively racist—and settled. Sentiment against that flag crested last year with the mass shooting at a black church in Charleston, South Carolina. The accused murderer, Dylann Roof, was an avowed racist who had photographed himself with the Confederate flag; after the murders, South Carolina removed it from the capitol grounds, and mainstream retailers like Walmart and Amazon stopped selling merchandise that featured the design. We have no real context for what that aggrieved postal worker experienced, or for the motives of his Gadsden-fan colleague.

43,Donald Trump said that $15 an hour is too much for essential workers,"Can you provide a specific source or context where Donald Trump explicitly stated that $15 an hour is too much for essential workers?		
The next year, fast food workers went on strike in New York City, demanding $15 per hour and union recognition. At the time, the New York state minimum wage was the same as the federal: $7.25 per hour. The city of New York had a living wage ordinance in place that set the living wage at $10 per hour. The demand for $15 seemed impossible, as it would mean more than doubling the minimum wage, and even far surpassing the established “living wage” (Rolf, 2016). Where did the $15 demand emerge from? There are a few explanations, suggesting that the demand was brewing in difficult locations and happened to coalesce at the same moment.

Among those earning under $15 per hour, 91% say their stress has increased, compared to 84% of those earning over $21 per hour. Remarkably high numbers of essential workers are suffering from going to work to support the rest of us. Workers point to three key sources of stress. The first is the general increase in workload as business in the few open sectors of the economy intensifies and workers call out sick. Those remaining on the job feel the desperate crunch of this intensification. The second is customers who, growing increasingly frustrated with restrictions, abuse the essential workers who take the risk of supporting the rest of us.

Note that this is similar to the UK experience when the Chancellor George Osborne announced the creation of the new “living wage” in 2015. This came alongside an effort to cut back in-work benefits (Clarke and D’Arcy, 2016). According to some analyses, many voters who elected Trump did so because they felt the mainstream candidates and parties had ignored working class issues. This suggests the wage issue is still ripe for organizing, and public support will remain high. A current bill to raise the federal minimum to $15 by 2024 would benefit 41 million workers (Owens, 2017).

Raising the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour for all workers, including tipped workers and workers with disabilities: I will fight to pass the Raise the Wage Act, which increases the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour for all workers - including tipped workers and workers with disabilities - and indexes the minimum wage to median wage growth. While I push to enact that legislation, I will sign an executive order on the first day of my administration to require all federal contractors to pay a $15-an-hour minimum wage. Providing more overtime pay to millions of workers by reviving and expanding the Obama-era overtime rule: The Department of Labor under President Obama issued a rule that doubled the salary threshold under which salaried workers must automatically receive overtime pay.

Overwhelmingly, Republican presidential candidates have agreed.

President Donald Trump said during Thursday night’s presidential debate that he would “consider” raising the federal minimum wage to $15 per hour if he’s re-elected—a level that Democrat Joe Biden has committed to—but said he’d also strongly prefer to let states decide for themselves, in what was a rare moment where the candidates discussed increasing the minimum wage while the issue appears a top priority for many voters. Trump said he’d like to see states decide on what the minimum wage rate should be themselves, saying that “Alabama is different from New York, New York is different from Vermont, every state is different.” Biden, on the other hand, has committed to a $15 per hour minimum wage, as more moderate Democrats have embraced the wage increase previously touted by the likes of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and others on the political left.

Chickenpox is a very common childhood disease caused by the Varicella-zoster virus (VZV). It is highly contagious and is found worldwide. There is a preventative vaccine available, but not all parents choose to have their children vaccinated. “Chickenpox parties”, which were prevalent in the 1970’s and 80’s, have re-emerged among social groups who identify as anti-vaccination. In this article, we examine the Pox Party practice and the potential risks they pose.

“It’s a terrible idea,” Dr. Tara C. Smith, a professor of epidemiology at Kent State University in Ohio, said. “We have a better way to prevent chickenpox now, so why put your child through that?” A so-called chickenpox party is when parents intentionally expose their unvaccinated children to others who have the highly contagious virus. The hope is to have your child catch the virus and get it over with, as it’s more dangerous to adults than kids.
		

Is deliberately infecting children with COVID-19 in ""pox parties"" ethically acceptable and safe for their health, considering the potential risks and the effectiveness of vaccines in creating herd immunity?		
The chickenpox used to be a childhood rite of passage as being exposed to the highly infectious disease at an early age was (nearly) inevitable. But since the Canadian debut of the chickenpox vaccine in 1998, the need to expose children to the itchy, blistery and potentially deadly virus, has significantly dropped. Despite health experts saying the vaccine is highly effective and safe, some parents are still choosing to forgo this method and instead expose children to the chickenpox the old fashioned way — with an infection party. Kentucky’s governor recently made headlines after he revealed he purposely exposed his unvaccinated children to chickenpox.

There is no need to host or attend these parties anymore, but some parents, especially those who do not believe in vaccines, still prefer this method over immunization. Smith said “it makes no sense,” as the vaccine has a lower dose of the virus than getting the full-blown disease. “Rather than getting a weakened version of it, they would rather have the wild type, which can cause death and you have a higher risk of getting shingles later on in life,” she said. The idea of exposing kids to the chickenpox (even after the vaccine debuted) has been around for years.

It is possible that an additional booster of the vaccine will be indicated after the first two childhood doses are administered. Nevertheless, even those who have a reduced immunity from the vaccine and do catch the virus will have a much milder case of the disease. Aside from the potential severe complications of the chickenpox disease in party attendees, there are other risks to consider when deliberately exposing a child in this way: Chickenpox is extremely contagious 1 to 2 days before any symptoms appear. This means that someone could unknowingly spread the disease to those who are most at risk of developing severe complications from chickenpox.

45,Cutting the umbilical cord straight away deliberately denies the baby natural immunity so that medical professionals have a reason to vaccinate and medicate them.,"What is the current scientific consensus on the benefits of delayed umbilical cord clamping in relation to neonatal immunity, and how does this compare to the role of vaccinations and medications given to newborns?		
The Cochrane Library recently published a review looking at 15 different trials on cord clamping. They found that for the mother, there seemed to be no difference between cutting immediately and waiting a few minutes. But for infants, they found that the benefits of waiting to clamp and cut seemed to outweigh the risks: A more liberal approach to delaying clamping of the umbilical cord in healthy term infants appears to be warranted, particularly in light of growing evidence that delayed cord clamping increases early haemoglobin concentrations and iron stores in infants. Delayed cord clamping is likely to be beneficial as long as access to treatment for jaundice requiring phototherapy is available.

In most births in the United States, the umbilical cord is clamped and cut 15 to 20 seconds after birth. However, this timeframe has received increased attention in recent years in relation to a practice known as delayed cord clamping. Some health care providers believe that allowing more time for blood to flow from the placenta into the baby after birth may be beneficial – especially for premature infants. Think of it as a blood transfusion from the baby to itself before the placenta is delivered.

Effective resuscitation at birth can prevent a large proportion of these deaths. The need for clinical guidelines on basic neonatal resuscitation, suitable for settings with limited resources, is universally recognized and WHO has thus published Guidelines on basic newborn resuscitation (2). In many settings, immediate clamping and cutting of the umbilical cord is needed in order to begin resuscitation protocols for the infant, largely due to the location of resuscitation equipment in the delivery room that requires transfer of the neonate. Whether resuscitation with the cord intact is beneficial is an unanswered question, though recent research has shown that it is a feasible practice, at least in some settings (16). Immediate and long-term benefits of delayed umbilical cord clamping for infants and mothers, based on the results of randomized controlled trials and other type of studies, are summarized in .

But those doctors overestimated the benefit to the mother and didn't look at the impact their change had on the babies, said Heike Rabe, a researcher at Brighton and Sussex Medical School and University Hospitals, in the United Kingdom, who wrote an editorial accompanying the study. For babies born at full-term, ""we should trust nature more than we do now,"" she said. Rabe has published reviews showing that delaying clamping for 30 seconds, or squeezing the umbilical cord to get the blood out faster, is also better for premature babies. Many countries and professional organizations, including the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, have called on obstetricians to delay cord clamping in premature babies when feasible.
		

What is the current scientific consensus on the benefits of delayed umbilical cord clamping in relation to neonatal immunity, and how does this compare to the role of vaccinations and medications given to newborns?		
However, the most recent scientific studies on cord clamping seem to indicate that delayed cord clamping may be beneficial to both premature and full-term babies. There is no debate that delayed clamping of the umbilical cord after birth allows more blood to flow from the placenta to the newborn baby, thereby significantly increasing the baby's blood volume at birth. The health benefits of this effect in premature babies is well-recognized. The question has always been whether this increase in blood volume offered any major health benefits for full-sized, full-term, otherwise healthy babies. However, a number of medical studies have recently been published which clearly indicate that even health, full-term newborns benefit from DCC and the resulting increase in blood volume.
		

What is the current scientific consensus on the benefits of delayed umbilical cord clamping in relation to neonatal immunity, and how does this compare to the role of vaccinations and medications given to newborns?		
2. The benefits are even greater for preterm babies Babies born prematurely are at risk for serious health problems, and an extra boost of healthy blood from the umbilical cord can help lower that risk. According to Barnes, delayed cord clamping in preterm babies has been shown to decrease the number of needed blood transfusions and reduce the risk of necrotizing enterocolitis (a severe complication involving the intestines of a preterm baby) and interventricular hemorrhage (a bleed in the baby’s brain that can cause lifelong neurologic problems). Because cord clamping can take place after the placenta has been removed from the mother’s uterus, there is no added risk to the mother or child to delay cord clamping after a cesarean birth.

“In recent years, more information has accumulated that showed that even among full-term infants, delaying clamping of the baby’s umbilical cord can be helpful also,” she added. Doctors traditionally cut the cord so quickly because of long-held beliefs that placental blood flow could increase birth complications such as neonatal respiratory distress, a type of blood cancer called polycythemia and jaundice from rapid transfusion of a large volume of blood. However, recent research has shown that delayed clamping does not cause complications in either the mother or the child. “There has also been concern about whether delayed cord clamping would pose more risk to the mother, specifically, would it lead to more risk of excessive blood loss at the time of delivery,” Mascola wrote in the e-mail.

Whether you’ve given birth or only seen it in the movies, you know that cutting the umbilical cord is an important early step after the baby is born. The baby comes out, whether vaginally or via C-section, the cord is clamped and cut, and things progress from there. Now, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists is the latest major medical organization to recommend that doctors wait before clamping and cutting the cord.

She writes that for a long time doctors waited until the umbilical cord stopped pulsing before cutting it—the idea was that the blood in the cord belongs in the baby and not on the floor. This is certainly true, as cutting the cord immediately after the baby is born steals from them between 80 and 100 milliliters of blood. But since the 1800s, things have changed, Dahlen writes: However, as intervention in birth climbed in the 1950s and 60s, concerns about the amount of pain-relieving drugs and anaesthetic reaching the baby from the mother’s blood increasingly led to immediate clamping and cutting of the cord.

NICHD scientist explains what’s known about when to cut, and when to wait Barrett Whitener: How soon after a baby is born should the practitioner wait to cut the umbilical cord? That simple question has no easy answer. Cutting the cord too soon after birth might stress the baby’s heart, increase the risk for bleeding inside the brain, and increase the risk for anemia and iron deficiency. Waiting too long may result in the infant having too many red blood cells. The excess red cells could lead to newborn jaundice, a kind of blood poisoning resulting from the breakdown of the extra red cells.
		

What is the recommended timing for cutting the umbilical cord according to current medical guidelines and research, and how does this timing impact the newborn's blood volume and overall health immediately after birth?		
Typically, when your baby is delivered, your medical team places your baby on your chest while the umbilical cord is still attached to your placenta. After at least a minute, they will place a clamp on the cord to stop the blood flow between you and your baby, and then, your partner or your doctor will use scissors to cut the cord. The rest of the cord will then be delivered, along with the placenta. This delay of a minute or so before cutting the cord allows the cord to pulsate and blood to flow from the placenta to the baby, explains obstetrician/gynecologist Augustina Addison, MD. Starting in the 1950s, doctors would cut the cord within seconds after birth. However, in the early 2000s, researchers discovered that waiting a minute or more before cord-cutting benefits babies.

Biden hasn’t explicitly said how or when that move away from fossil fuels would affect fracking, but Trump has used the proposal to tell audiences, inaccurately, that his opponent wants to ban fracking now.
		

Has Joe Biden officially announced a policy or made a statement explicitly stating his intention to ban fracking in the United States?		
Biden’s remarks came after Trump, speaking Thursday on the final night of the Republican National Convention, accused him of wanting to “abolish” natural gas production in the United States. Fracking is used to extract natural gas from reservoirs deep beneath the Earth’s surface. We’ve examined Biden’s position on fracking before, so we know he has not called for banning the practice. He wants to block the federal government from issuing new permits for drilling on public lands but would allow existing fracking operations to continue.

Fact-checking Joe Biden in Pennsylvania on his fracking policy Biden wants to block the federal government from issuing new permits for drilling on public lands but would allow existing fracking operations to continue. Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden appeared Monday in Pittsburgh and defended his position on hydraulic fracturing, or fracking — a controversial drilling technique that has lifted the economy in Western Pennsylvania. “I am not banning fracking. Let me say that again. I am not banning fracking. No matter how many times Donald Trump lies about me,” said Biden, who spoke at a Carnegie Mellon University robotics institute.
		

Has Joe Biden officially announced a policy or made a statement explicitly stating his intention to ban fracking in the United States?		
The Biden campaign retracted his remarks the night of the debate, but that hasn’t stopped conservative media outlets from inaccurately reporting that Biden supports a total ban on fracking. Biden said he’s “not banning fracking” if he wins in November. Ban means “prohibit,” and Biden doesn’t want to prohibit fracking. He would allow existing fracking to continue. Biden does, however, want to stop issuing new permits for fracking on public lands, and he left that part out of his speech in Pittsburgh. Biden’s statement is accurate but needs clarification. We rate it Mostly True.
		

Has Joe Biden officially announced a policy or made a statement explicitly stating his intention to ban fracking in the United States?		
Former Vice President Joe Biden claimed that he “never said I oppose fracking” when pressed by President Donald Trump on the issue during Thursday night’s presidential debate. Facts First: It’s false that Biden never said he opposed fracking. In two Democratic primary debates, Biden made confusing remarks over fracking that his campaign had to clarify. In 2019, Biden said “we would make sure it’s eliminated” when asked about the future of coal and fracking; in 2020 he said he opposed “new fracking.” Biden’s written plan, conversely, never included a full ban on fracking or even on new fracking. Rather, it proposes “banning new oil and gas permitting on public lands and waters” – not ending all new fracking anywhere or ending all existing fracking on public lands and waters.
		

Has Joe Biden officially announced a policy or made a statement explicitly stating his intention to ban fracking in the United States?		
“I'm talking about stopping fracking as soon as we possibly can,” Sanders said. “I'm talking about telling the fossil fuel industry that they are going to stop destroying this planet — no ifs, buts and maybes about it. Later, Sanders said that he thinks Biden wants to continue fracking. A Biden spokesman told Lisa Friedman, a New York Times reporter, that the remark was restating his plan on “banning new oil and gas permitting on public lands and waters,” according to a tweet she posted the day of the debate. The claim that Joe Biden wants to eliminate fracking is false because it ignores his publicly stated opposition to such a ban.
		

Has Joe Biden officially announced a policy or made a statement explicitly stating his intention to ban fracking in the United States?		
Fact Check: Joe Biden wants to eliminate new fracking permits, not all fracking The claim that presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden wants to eliminate fracking has been made for much of the presidential campaign. This summer, it was made in a post on Facebook and is similar to an ad by America First Action, a pro-Trump Political Action Committee. It includes a video of Biden answering a question in a primary debate and a claim that Biden could cost Pennsylvania more than 600,000 jobs.

“They want to abolish fossil fuels and ban fracking,” Pence said. “Joe Biden will not ban fracking, he’s been very clear about that,” countered Harris. In fact, Joe Biden can’t actually ban fracking, at least not in Pennsylvania. The technology that helped tap Pennsylvania’s deeply buried shale gas transformed some of the state’s quiet farm and forest communities over the past 12 years.
		

Has Joe Biden officially announced a policy or made a statement explicitly stating his intention to ban fracking in the United States?		
Some critics concluded that Biden would implement a full ban on fracking after comments he made during a one-on-one debate with Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders in March. “I’m talking about stopping fracking as soon as we possibly can,” said Sanders, stating his support for an all-out ban. “I’m talking about telling the fossil fuel industry that they are going to stop destroying this planet — no ifs, buts and maybes about it.” “So am I,” said Biden, before later adding: “No more – no new fracking.”
		

Has Joe Biden officially announced a policy or made a statement explicitly stating his intention to ban fracking in the United States?		
Trump has already falsely claimed that Biden wants to ban fracking, in an effort to undermine the Democrat’s efforts with Keystone State voters. “It is not a good message for Joe Biden, who is trying to get traction in Pennsylvania on energy issues, and in rust belt states like Ohio,” said Madrid. “We can debate whether this hurts Joe Biden, but it certainly doesn’t help.” But some Democratic political consultants note that there are clear differences between same-sex marriage in 2003 and aggressive climate change regulations in 2020.

48,99% of people recover from COVID-19.,"What is the most recent and reliable data on the recovery rate of COVID-19 patients globally, accounting for varying definitions of ""recovery"" and different healthcare contexts?		
It’s a question that many want answered: Exactly how many people recover from Covid-19? Most people with Covid-19 have mild illness and are able to recover at home without medical care, while severe cases often receive supportive care in the hospital, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Although there have been regional, national and global data on confirmed cases and deaths, not much has been reported on recovery. Johns Hopkins University, which is among few institutions that have been tracking recovered cases, has been doing so since its data collection on Covid-19 cases was first made public in an online dashboard in January, Douglas Donovan, a spokesman for the university in Baltimore, said in an email on Friday.
		

What is the most recent and reliable data on the recovery rate of COVID-19 patients globally, accounting for varying definitions of ""recovery"" and different healthcare contexts?		
That may change as more uniform reporting for recoveries expands among local and state governments,” he said. “Currently there is no uniform method for reporting recoveries across the United States. If that changes the dashboard will reflect those numbers accordingly.” As of Saturday, more than 223,000 people worldwide have recovered from Covid-19, according to data from the Johns Hopkins University dashboard. The actual figure is likely to be higher since the data only cover confirmed cases.

Recovering From Coronavirus: What to Expect During and After Your RecoveryApril 8, 2020 - Katie McCallum If you've just been diagnosed with COVID-19, you probably have a lot of questions, including, ""What's next?"" Here's what to expect as you recover from COVID-19, as well what you need to know once you've recovered. The COVID-19 recovery process, including how quickly you can expect to recover, depends on whether you have a mild, moderate or severe case of the illness.
		

What is the most recent and reliable data on the recovery rate of COVID-19 patients globally, accounting for varying definitions of ""recovery"" and different healthcare contexts?		
An unselected cohort of 100 patients who recently recovered from COVID-19 infection were included, of which 53 (53%) were male, and the mean (SD) age was 49 (14) years. Baseline characteristics are provided in Table 1. Most patients recovered at home (n = 67), with severity of the acute COVID-19 illness ranging from asymptomatic (n = 18) to minor to moderate symptoms (n = 49). A total of 33 severely unwell patients (33%) required hospitalization. In this group, 2 patients (2%) underwent mechanical ventilation, and 17 (17%) underwent noninvasive ventilation with positive airway pressure. Oxygen supplementation was required in 28 patients. In addition to respiratory support, patients received antiviral (n = 1), antibiotic (n = 15), and steroid (n = 8) therapy.
		

What is the most recent and reliable data on the recovery rate of COVID-19 patients globally, accounting for varying definitions of ""recovery"" and different healthcare contexts?		
Mistakes can be generated because of the issues mentioned above as well as from the reports of patients who have recovered from COVID-19. Even though this value cannot be observed directly, it can be estimated through the report of deaths by the MSP and comparing them with the registry of the National Institute of Statistics of Ecuador. This comparison resulted in a difference of ≥20% and has been observed in other studies too [23–26]. Through an assessment of the first 100 cases of COVID-19, a marked difference in acceleration and control of the epidemic was made in Taiwan.
		

What is the most recent and reliable data on the recovery rate of COVID-19 patients globally, accounting for varying definitions of ""recovery"" and different healthcare contexts?		
“At an individual level, if people can know if they were asymptomatically or mildly infected and recovered, they can know that they are immune and can safely return to work once the shelter at home is eliminated.” There’s no evidence to date that people who recover from Covid-19 can get re-infected with the novel coronavirus – though there isn’t a lot of data in general, Hota said. He added that identifying those who recover could help indicate those who have built immunity, at least in the short term. “This is a little bit of an understudied group,” Hota said about recovered Covid-19 patients. “Being able to [identify recovered patients]…and say you’ve been exposed, you’ve recovered, and we believe you’re immune, I think that’ll be very powerful.”
		

What is the most recent and reliable data on the recovery rate of COVID-19 patients globally, accounting for varying definitions of ""recovery"" and different healthcare contexts?		
According to the MSP, it takes 20 days, which poses problems for healthcare units in terms of space and resources [5, 23, 24]. Determining this value is a key component in the prediction based on SIR models because it is based on local data. Subsequently, extrapolations can be made in the hope that they are not too far from reality. In our study, the time for recovery from COVID-19 was based on a K model and observing how the recovery curve was adjusted to the true situation.
		

What is the most recent and reliable data on the recovery rate of COVID-19 patients globally, accounting for varying definitions of ""recovery"" and different healthcare contexts?		
“It takes anything up to six weeks to recover from this disease,” Ryan said. “People who suffer very severe illness can take months to recover from the illness.” Ryan added that recovery is often measured as the patient no longer exhibiting symptoms and having two consecutive negative tests for the virus at least one day apart – but some countries may measure “recovery” differently. Also, confirming recovery can differ from confirming whether someone is still carrying the virus – and that’s where some confusion may emerge. Estimates have ranged regarding how long the novel coronavirus may linger in the body.
		

What is the most recent and reliable data on the recovery rate of COVID-19 patients globally, accounting for varying definitions of ""recovery"" and different healthcare contexts?		
Approximately 80% of patients hospitalized with COVID-19, and 60% of those admitted to intensive care units (ICUs), survive. However, similar to the experiences of other sepsis survivors,1 many COVID-19 survivors are likely to experience long-lasting morbidity. Since SARS-CoV-2 was just discovered in January 2020, little published data are available on long-term outcomes and recovery after severe COVID-19. Yet studies in related patient populations, such as those affected with other coronaviruses, all-cause sepsis, or general critical illness, are helpful when considering the likely outcomes of COVID-19 survivors.
		

What is the most recent and reliable data on the recovery rate of COVID-19 patients globally, accounting for varying definitions of ""recovery"" and different healthcare contexts?		
- A period of at least seven days has passed since symptoms first appeared If they have access to testing, the criteria includes two consecutive tests that are negative and 24 hours apart, along with no longer having a fever and seeing improvement in symptoms. Recovered doesn’t mean that a patient immediately returns to feeling healthy. Hota said that many of his patients feel tired and still have a lingering cough even if they meet the recovery criteria. It can take several weeks to fully recover from illness caused by the novel coronavirus, Dr. Mike Ryan, executive director of the World Health Organization’s Health Emergencies Programme, said during a briefing in Geneva in early March.

49,The US saw the best carbon emission numbers in 35 years under President Donald Trump's administration.,"During President Donald Trump's administration, what were the reported carbon emission numbers, and how do they compare to the figures from the 35 years prior?		
“Whether Trump’s policies have had any significant positive or negative effect on U.S. carbon emissions is a separate question.” Schakowsky said that in the time Trump has been president, the nation has seen “an increase in carbon emissions going absolutely in the wrong way.” Reports show U.S. carbon dioxide emissions did spike on Trump’s watch in 2018. They fell again last year, but greenhouse gas emissions overall remain higher than they were before he took office. MOSTLY TRUE — The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.
		

During President Donald Trump's administration, what were the reported carbon emission numbers, and how do they compare to the figures from the 35 years prior?		
Other advanced economies like the EU and Japan have reduced emissions faster. The US remains the world’s second biggest emitter and the number one historical emitter. The average American’s carbon footprint is twice that of a Chinese or EU citizen and eight times that of an Indian. Emissions reductions under Trump are off the pace needed to meet the US’s climate targets and for the US to play its fair share in keeping global warming to 1.5C or 2C – the temperature limits in the Paris Agreement. According to the US Energy Information Administration, US CO2 emissions in 2019 were the lowest they have been since 1992.
		

During President Donald Trump's administration, what were the reported carbon emission numbers, and how do they compare to the figures from the 35 years prior?		
In 2018, PolitiFact rated Half True a claim from Trump’s EPA that greenhouse emissions were down under the president, finding that while emissions were continuing to fall, the rate of decline had slowed during Trump’s first year in office. The data at that time did not show emissions were rising. So we wanted to find out whether more recent figures support Schakowsky’s claim that emissions have increased under Trump, and whether the changes suggest a trend going “in the wrong way.” Overall, emissions are indeed up from 2016 levels following a spike in 2018. After that, carbon emissions again began to decline.
		

During President Donald Trump's administration, what were the reported carbon emission numbers, and how do they compare to the figures from the 35 years prior?		
At last week’s US presidential election debate, Donald Trump claimed: “We have now the lowest carbon. If you look at our numbers right now, we are doing phenomenally.” The truth is that Trump will go into November’s election with US a marginally less polluting country than when he came to power. US emissions have declined more slowly during Trump’s term than when Barack Obama was in the White House.
		

During President Donald Trump's administration, what were the reported carbon emission numbers, and how do they compare to the figures from the 35 years prior?		
In the decade before Trump took office, emissions fell by a total of 14.5%, due mainly to electric utilities shifting away from coal-fired plants in favor of cheaper, cleaner natural gas, as well as solar and wind power. Under Trump, the trend reversed with a 2.9% increase in 2018. But that year was an anomaly. A hotter than normal summer and colder than normal winter resulted in higher natural gas consumption. EIA is currently estimating that CO2 emissions fell 2.1% in 2019, and will continue going down this year and next.
		

During President Donald Trump's administration, what were the reported carbon emission numbers, and how do they compare to the figures from the 35 years prior?		
Under President Donald Trump, the US is set to leave the Paris accord in 2020 while his administration has ended many existing environmental protections. While the Rhodium report notes these figures - pulled from US Energy Information Administration data and other sources - are estimates, The Global Carbon Project, another research group, also reported a similar increase in US emissions for 2018. The US is the world's second largest emitter of greenhouse gases. And last year's spike comes despite a decline in coal-fired power plants; a record number were retired last year, according to the report.
		

During President Donald Trump's administration, what were the reported carbon emission numbers, and how do they compare to the figures from the 35 years prior?		
Under Mr Trump's administration, the federal government has also opened up once-protected lands for oil and gas drilling across the US and has proposed ending regulations on fuel standards for cars and trucks after 2021. ""The big takeaway for me is that we haven't yet successfully decoupled US emissions growth from economic growth,"" Rhodium climate and energy analyst Trevor Houser told the New York Times. The US jump also marks a worldwide trend: 2018 saw an all-time high for global CO2 emissions and was the fourth warmest year on record. Transportation remains the nation's number one source of CO2 emissions for the third year in a row.
		

During President Donald Trump's administration, what were the reported carbon emission numbers, and how do they compare to the figures from the 35 years prior?		
Experts interviewed say those incremental changes may have nothing to do with Trump policies. In response to our inquiry, a spokesman for Schakowsky’s office pointed to reports highlighting a 2018 spike in U.S. carbon dioxide emissions following three years of declines. A report published in May 2019 by the Rhodium Group, an independent research firm, estimated CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion rose 2.7% in 2018. It was the second-largest annual increase since 2000, the group reported, though somewhat smaller than an estimate it made earlier in the year based on preliminary data.
		

During President Donald Trump's administration, what were the reported carbon emission numbers, and how do they compare to the figures from the 35 years prior?		
The largest increase occurred in 2010 under then-President Barack Obama as the economy began its rebound from the recession, according to the group. In a draft report released this month, the EPA noted a similar uptick in 2018 CO2 emissions, which comprise the vast majority of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. So Schakowsky is correct there was a spike in carbon emissions on Trump’s watch. In 2019, however, U.S. carbon dioxide emissions fell again, according to several recent international reports. And that drop was not a surprise. Indeed, the preliminary Rhodium report for 2018 noted that while the pace of U.S. emissions decline had slowed since 2016, the group did not “expect a repeat” increase the following year.
		

During President Donald Trump's administration, what were the reported carbon emission numbers, and how do they compare to the figures from the 35 years prior?		
Report: US 2018 CO2 emissions saw biggest spike in years A new report has found that US carbon dioxide emissions rose by 3.4% in 2018 after three years of decline. The spike is the largest in eight years, according to Rhodium Group, an independent economic research firm. The data shows the US is unlikely to meet its pledge to reduce emissions by 2025 under the Paris climate agreement.

This well-worn attack against Biden is not true, although Biden’s position on the issue is complicated.

Hydraulic fracturing, known as fracking, is a practice used to tap into natural gas reserves deep below the earth's surface. It’s a critical issue in states like the battleground of Pennsylvania, where the practice has brought economic prosperity to several once-impoverished areas. It is controversial because many of the chemicals used in the process are toxic to humans and have been known to cause serious health problems in populations near fracking fields.

But Trump is downplaying the security assistance Ukraine received under Obama and Biden, which included hundreds of vehicles, drones, counter-mortar radars and medical supplies. On a phone call with reporters after the debate (also known as the virtual spin room), the Trump campaign went after Biden for his comments on phasing out oil in favor of more sustainable energy as part of his environmental plan. “Joe Biden realized he made a grave error in what he said,” the campaign's communications director, Tim Murtaugh, said.

The winners are: Mr Mahesh Prabhakar (BJP), ward 1, Mrs Sarita Rani (BJP) ward 2, Ms Saroj Bala (Independent) ward 3, Mr Ranjit Singh Saini (Congress) ward 4, Mrs Anita Sharma (Independent) ward 5, Mr Vidhya Sagar (Congress) ward 6, Mr Manjit Singh Pappa (Independent) ward 7, Mrs Asha Rani (Congress) ward 8, Mr Raj Singh Nangal (Congress) ward 9, Mr Sukhdev Singh Parmar (BJP ward 10, Mr Harminder Kaur Minhas (Congress) ward 11, Ms Vijay Kaushal (Independent) ward 12, Mr Bishan Das (CPI) ward 13, Mrs Rekha Rani (Congress) ward 14, Mr Bhupinder Singh Bhinda (Independent) ward 15, Mr Pratap Saini (Congress) ward 16, Mrs Nisha Sabarwal (Congress) ward 17. Polling was peaceful but for a few stray incidents of unrest in ward 16 where the candidates of the Congress and independents alleged bogus voting. While the leaders of the Congress termed their victory in these polls, as a referendum against the SAD/BJP government, the BJP attributed its loss of seats to lack of co-operation from local Akalis and the dissidents of their party.

52,President Ferdinand Marcos and Dr. Jose Rizal established and founded the WORLD BANK and International Monetary Fund.,"When were the World Bank and International Monetary Fund established, and who were the key figures involved in their founding?		
Conceived in 1944 at the Bretton Woods Monetary Conference in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire, the World Bank’s initial aim was to help rebuild European countries devastated by World War II. Its first loan was to France in 1947 for post-war reconstruction. Soon, however, other actors began to take over the role of reconstruction support and the Bank shifted its attention to the needs of its members in Latin America, Africa, and Asia. In the 1950s and 60s, the funding of large infrastructure projects, such as dams, electrical grids, irrigation systems, and roads was the Bank’s primary focus. The Bank’s technical assistance work, which provided countries with technical resources and training necessary to use the Bank’s loans effectively, was increasingly requested by member countries.

Furthermore, the Philippines was one of the poorest nations setting out on the nuclear path; only Japan, Taiwan, and South Korea were building nuclear power plants in East Asia, and they were far better off economically and technologically.[68] The power plant was the largest and most expensive construction project in the country’s history. Given the monumental expense, funding the project out of the government’s treasury was impossible, so the government turned to Export-Import Bank in Washington, DC, for assistance. In 1975, $277 million in direct loans and $367 million in loan guarantees was approved by Ex-Im Bank chairman William J. Casey, one of Marcos’s biggest supporters. It was the largest loan package the bank had approved anywhere.[69]
		

When were the World Bank and International Monetary Fund established, and who were the key figures involved in their founding?		
In an attempt to launch a national economic recovery program, Marcos negotiated with foreign creditors including the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, World Bank, and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), for a restructuring of the country's foreign debts – to give the Philippines more time to pay the loans. Marcos ordered a cut in government expenditures and used a portion of the savings to finance the Sariling Sikap (Self-Reliance), a livelihood program he established in 1984. From 1984 the economy began to decline, and continued to do so despite the government's recovery efforts. This failure was caused by civil unrest, rampant graft and corruption within the government and by Marcos' lack of credibility.
		

When were the World Bank and International Monetary Fund established, and who were the key figures involved in their founding?		
Upon winning the election, Marcos appointed a cabinet composed mostly of technocrats and intellectuals, most notably Executive Secretary Rafael Salas, Education Secretary Onofre Corpuz, Finance Secrtetary Cesar Virata, and National Economic and Development Authority Director General Gerardo Sicat.[7] In an effort to strengthen the influence of the Office of the President and simultaneously weaken the strong patronage bonds which rural Filipinos had with their local leaders, Marcos created the Presidential Arm on Community Development (PACD), which would initiate development projects at the barrio level without going through the Barrio and Municipal governments.[7] Marcos also took credit for the dramatic increase in rice production caused by the 1968 introduction of a new ""miracle rice"" variety, IR8, by the International Rice Research Institute in Los Baños, Laguna - although the IRRI program that developed the variety had started as early as 1962, during the Macapagal administration, and was the product of an International consortium, not the Philippine government.[13] During this first term, Marcos also began systematically cultivating a group entrepreneurs and industrialists loyal to him, rather than the Philippines' ruling class of landowners, making these cronies richer and more powerful through what would later be called ""behest loans"", which funnelled foreign assistance and ""soft loans"" to their businesses on the pretense of spurring industrial development.[7]

His inauguration marked the beginning of his two-decade long stay in power, even though the 1935 Philippine Constitution had set a limit of only two four-year terms of office. Marcos had won the Philippine presidential election of 1965 against the incumbent president, Diosdado Macapagal. Before Marcos' Presidency, the Philippines was the second largest economy in Asia, behind only Japan.[1]

Ferdinand Emmanuel Edralín Marcos (September 11, 1917 – September 28, 1989) was President of the Philippines from 1965 to 1986. He was a lawyer, member of the Philippine House of Representatives (1949-1959) and a member of the Philippine Senate (1959-1965). As Philippine president and strongman, Marcos led his country in its post-war reconstruction. Initially, his intentions were laudable, to improve the economy and to increase agricultural productivity and to dismantle the oligarchy that had dominated the nation. His greatest achievements were in the areas of infrastructure development, safeguarding the country against communism, and international diplomacy.

Some of his closest allies also stole billions. As their victim was a nation in which 40% of the people survive on less than $2 a day, the Republic of the Philippines decided urgently to try to retrieve its money. Even amid the chaos of the revolution, the very first executive order issued by the new president, Cory Aquino, established the Presidential Commission on Good Government, the PCGG. It was to recover “all ill-gotten wealth accumulated by former president Ferdinand Marcos, his immediate family, relatives, subordinates and close associates” and given the power to sequester any assets believed to be the proceeds of crime. Thirty years later, the PCGG is still working, its 94 lawyers, researchers and administrators housed proudly in a building recovered from the Marcos family.

(1917–89). The annual salary of Ferdinand Marcos as president of the Philippines was 5,700 dollars. After 20 years in office, it was estimated that he had built a personal fortune in excess of 5 billion dollars. When he and his wife, Imelda, were forced to flee the country in 1986, the economy of the Philippines was in ruins, the treasury had been looted, and money from foreign aid had been siphoned off by Marcos and his friends. Ferdinand Edralin Marcos was born on Sept. 11, 1917, in Sarrat in the Philippines. He attended school in Manila and studied law at the University of the Philippines. After being acquitted in 1940 of the 1933 assassination of a political opponent of his politician father, he became a trial lawyer.

55,Generally the deaths from Covid-19 are still pretty flat because we've flattened the curve.,"How have the trends in COVID-19 death rates changed in relation to the implementation of measures aimed at flattening the curve, and what current data supports this trend?		
It's the origin of the ubiquitous term ""flattening the curve"" in discussions about COVID-19. Flattening the curve is primarily aimed at protecting the capacity of healthcare systems to treat serious cases of COVID-19 while maintaining other essential care. A relatively small but significant number of cases are serious enough to warrant hospitalization, with the most serious requiring intensive care. As is the case across the United States, Wisconsin has seen demographic disparities in the number and severity of COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations and deaths, as well as the distribution of vaccines.
		

How have the trends in COVID-19 death rates changed in relation to the implementation of measures aimed at flattening the curve, and what current data supports this trend?		
The trend line of these moving averages is sensitive to fluctuating daily numbers, and can help indicate when an outbreak is surging, has peaked or is declining. The total number of people in Wisconsin who have tested positive for COVID-19 and those who have died as a result are a longer-term metric of how the disease has affected the state. If cases and deaths are growing rapidly by the day, the pace of total infections and fatalities over time will have steep upward trajectories, while decreases in daily numbers leads to a flatter line. The case fatality rate is another key COVID-19 metric. This measure reflects the percentage of confirmed cases that have resulted in a death attributed to the disease.
		

How have the trends in COVID-19 death rates changed in relation to the implementation of measures aimed at flattening the curve, and what current data supports this trend?		
This graph shows the trend over time in the number of COVID-19 deaths among confirmed COVID-19 cases in Wisconsin. The bars (dark blue) show the number of newly reported deaths among confirmed COVID-19 cases for a particular day.

How have the trends in COVID-19 death rates changed in relation to the implementation of measures aimed at flattening the curve, and what current data supports this trend?		
Fluctuations in daily deaths are a lagging indicator reflecting a preceding change in cases. The goal of public health officials is for the number of new confirmed cases and deaths to fall over time. Since the period between coronavirus exposure and the onset of symptoms can be up to two weeks, and death in serious cases can follow long after infection, discernible effects of public health measures are delayed. A simple way to understand the short-term dynamics of an outbreak is to track a 7-day moving average of newly confirmed cases and deaths.
		

How have the trends in COVID-19 death rates changed in relation to the implementation of measures aimed at flattening the curve, and what current data supports this trend?		
This figure shows the distribution of COVID-19 deaths across age group, gender, race, ethnicity, and region. These are shown as a percentage of total deaths and can be further broken down by case confirmation status. These figures can be used to examine demographic groups that may be experiencing disproportionately high rates of death associated with COVID-19 which may highlight any underlying health inequities.

First of all, experts say there has been no study connecting the flu shot with an increased risk of SARS-CoV-2, the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19. The central study cited by the Children’s Health Defense is a 2019 Armed Forces Health Surveillance Branch study that probed the theory that “influenza vaccination may increase the risk of other respiratory viruses” — a concept known as “virus interference.” Edward Belongia, an infectious disease epidemiologist at the Marshfield Clinic Research Institute, told us that the theory rests on the idea that “if you get a flu infection, for example, maybe for some period of time your immune response to that flu infection reduces your risk of getting infected by some other virus.” Belongia said virus interference has been the subject of speculation and some studies with mixed results, but there is ultimately little data to support it.
		

Did any scientific studies or health experts provide evidence or rationale linking flu vaccines to increased susceptibility to COVID-19, particularly in the case of President Donald Trump?		
A 2013 study he worked on, cited in the AFHSB study, found that “influenza vaccination was not associated with detection of noninfluenza respiratory viruses.” In fact, the AFHSB study concluded that its “overall results … showed little to no evidence supporting the association of virus interference and influenza vaccination.” The erroneous claim that the study shows a heightened risk for COVID-19 for those vaccinated for the flu hinges on the study’s suggestion that vaccinated individuals appeared more likely to get “coronavirus.” But the study looked at four types of seasonal coronaviruses that cause common colds, not SARS-CoV-2.

In an October interview with NPR, virologist Robert Gallo, co-founder and director of the Institute of Human Virology at the University of Maryland School of Medicine, said that getting the right flu vaccine, one that contains a live, attenuated (or weakened) virus, is key. Injecting with this sort of vaccine may sound a bit terrifying. But in reality, it is used in the tuberculosis vaccine, or Bacille Calmette-Guerin, given in developing countries, as well as the oral polio, measles and live flu vaccines.

But none of the studies referenced assessed risks of the flu shot when it comes to COVID-19. For example, Sharon Rikin, an assistant professor of medicine at Albert Einstein College of Medicine and Montefiore Medical Center, said in an email that a 2018 study she worked on “showed an association with flu vaccination and a slightly higher risk of non-flu acute respiratory infections (such as the common cold) in children. “In medicine, we are always weighing the risks and benefits of treatments. In this case, we know that the flu vaccine is safe and effective to reduce illness and death among children and adults every year,” Rikin added. “We have not studied the association between flu vaccination and risk of COVID-19. Fortunately, COVID-19 is typically not causing significant illness in children.

In a September study published in the Journal of Clinical and Translational Science, Cleveland Clinic pulmonologist Dr. Joe Zein and colleagues found that the influenza vaccine did not increase one's susceptibility to COVID-19 nor worsen associated morbidity or mortality. The study examined almost 20,000 patients enrolled in the clinic's COVID-19 registry who tested positive for the virus between March 8 and April 15. Patients who received a flu vaccine in the fall or winter of 2019 were compared against those who did not. ""Our findings suggest that we should proceed as usual with our vaccination strategy for global influenza this flu season,” Zein said in press release.

Grand Island's 2020 budget raises the tax levy by nearly 3.5%, an increase that remains within the state's property tax cap. The Town Board on Thursday approved the $24.5 million budget, which raises spending by 4.86%. The overall levy, the amount the town collects in property taxes, would rise by 3.47% to $10.6 million, within the tax cap of 3.54%, said supervising accountant Pam Barton. General fund, highway department, fire protection district and water district spending all rises next year.

The general fund tax rate would rise by 2.2% to $1.23 per $1,000 of assessed value. The water district tax rate has the sharpest increase, by 34%, to $2.67 per $1,000. Barton said this is driven by a one-time increase of $150,000 to pay for a hydrant replacement project that began this fall. The budget includes pay raises for some elected officials, including highway superintendent (3.6%), town clerk and town justices (all received 1.5% raises). The supervisor's pay was reduced by 2.8%, to $70,762, because a new person is filling the role, a standard town practice.

FACT CHECK: Is Russia Really Sending Medical Supplies To The United States? During his briefing with the coronavirus task force on Monday, President Trump said Russia has sent medical equipment to the United States to combat the growing pandemic. ""And I have to say, we've had great relationships with a lot of countries,"" Trump said. ""Russia sent us a very, very large planeload of things, medical equipment, which was very nice."" The short answer: Yes — but it hasn't happened yet.
		

Did Russia officially send medical equipment to the United States specifically to assist with the treatment of coronavirus patients during the pandemic?		
A total of 200 U.S.-manufactured ventilators were to be delivered, including a second batch expected to arrive next week. The donation came after Russia sent a cargo of medical supplies to New York in early April, and after a phone conversation between Presidents Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin. The United States has more confirmed COVID-19 cases than any other nation, at almost 1.6 million. Russia has the second largest outbreak with over 326,000. While U.S.-Russia relations remain strained, diplomats on both sides have welcomed the exchange of medical supplied amid the pandemic.

Russia welcomes coronavirus ""good will"" delivery of ventilators from U.S. agency it banned Moscow — The United States delivered its first batch of coronavirus humanitarian aid, including dozens of ventilators, to Russia this week. The delivery came just weeks after Russia sent a similar shipment to the U.S., and as both countries continue to battle the spread of COVID-19. The U.S. Embassy in Moscow said on Thursday that 50 ventilators had arrived in the Russian capital as part of the $5.6 million humanitarian package.
		

Did Russia officially send medical equipment to the United States specifically to assist with the treatment of coronavirus patients during the pandemic?		
Former State Department officials were “mystified” and “bemused” by the United States’ purchase of medical supplies from Russia amid the coronavirus pandemic – a move that experts say is a propaganda win for the Kremlin. A Russian plane with the equipment touched down in New York City on Wednesday, with an air traffic controller thanking the pilot “for all the assistance you are bringing in.” The delivery came days after President Donald Trump spoke by phone with his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin. According to State Department spokesperson Morgan Ortagus, the US purchased the supplies, which included ventilators and personal protection equipment.

Did Russia officially send medical equipment to the United States specifically to assist with the treatment of coronavirus patients during the pandemic?		
More striking was Russia’s delivery of medical assistance to the United States. A Russian Air Force cargo plane landed in New York on April 1 carrying protective gear and ventilators. The nature of this delivery was described differently by the two countries: Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov declared that ""Trump accepted this humanitarian aid with gratitude,"" but the State Department emphasized that the supplies were purchased. Either way, Russian assistance stands out amid the mutual recrimination that has characterized U.S.-Russia relations for the last several years. It also allows Moscow to call attention to Washington’s inadequate response to the pandemic and to reverse the longstanding portrayal of Russia as dependent on the West.
		

Did Russia officially send medical equipment to the United States specifically to assist with the treatment of coronavirus patients during the pandemic?		
In an apparent error, Trump on Monday said the aid had already arrived from Russia, telling reporters in the White House Rose Garden: “Russia sent us a very, very large planeload of things, medical equipment, which was very nice.” Later, the Kremlin announced that Putin had offered Trump the aid during a one-on-one telephone conversation when the two sides discussed measures to fight coronavirus. “Trump gratefully accepted this humanitarian aid,” Putin spokesman Dmitri Peskov told reporters. “Now that this situation has affected everyone without exception and is global, there is no alternative to joint action in the spirit of partnership and mutual help.” Peskov also said that Putin “assumes that when US makers of medical equipment and materials have gained speed, they too will be able to reciprocate if necessary”.
		

Did Russia officially send medical equipment to the United States specifically to assist with the treatment of coronavirus patients during the pandemic?		
The Federal Emergency Management Agency has “disposed” of faulty ventilators donated by Russia that were manufactured by a company under U.S. sanctions as part of a lopsided exchange of medical supplies during the height of the pandemic. In March, as coronavirus cases in the U.S. began to soar and states struggled with shortages of personal protective equipment and ventilators, President Donald Trump reached out to Russian President Vladimir Putin for help, who said he would send a military transport plane filled with medical equipment to the U.S. The plane landed at New York’s John F. Kennedy airport in April, and the equipment, including 45 ventilators, was distributed to warehouses in New York and New Jersey. But the Aventa-M ventilators were never used – they required an electrical voltage not compatible in the U.S., which means they couldn’t be used in the hospitals without an adapter that wasn’t readily available, Buzzfeed News reported, and just a few weeks later, the same model ventilator burst into flames in Russia, killing six people.
		

Did Russia officially send medical equipment to the United States specifically to assist with the treatment of coronavirus patients during the pandemic?		
The long answer: According to a senior administration official at the White House, Russia is expected to deliver a planeload of supplies and personal protection equipment on Wednesday. That follows a phone call with Trump in which President Vladimir Putin offered to send supplies to the United States. Items that are already approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration will be put to immediate use, the official said. Speaking to the Interfax news agency on Tuesday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Trump accepted Putin's offer for shipping medical equipment to the United States during a phone call in which the leaders discussed the pandemic and oil markets.
		

Did Russia officially send medical equipment to the United States specifically to assist with the treatment of coronavirus patients during the pandemic?		
As Italy’s commissioner for the coronavirus emergency pointed out, “France has given us 2 million masks, Germany has sent us a few dozen ventilators … planes from Russia . . . brought 180 doctors, nurses, ventilators, and masks.” Russia has also sent military medics and medical equipment to Serbia. This assistance included 11 flights and 87 military medics. Russian state media has reported that personnel have now disinfected arenas, provided consultations, trained Serbian personnel, and “analyzed the epidemiological situation.”

This helps rule out any fake reviews left by fraudsters. These are when a fraudster contacts you and pretends to be someone else. They’ll pretend to be your bank, HMRC, or another trusted person to convince you to send them money. An example of this could be: You get a call from Santander on a known and trusted number.

Covid: Do all tier 3 area workers get 80% of their wages? The claim: Employees unable to work in tier 3 areas will get a combination of Job Support Scheme and Universal Credit, which will mean they get 80% of their wages. Verdict: While that will be the case for some workers, especially those on very low incomes, some workers will get less than 80% under the new scheme. The prime minister has repeatedly claimed that employees of closed businesses in tier 3 areas will get 80% of their income.
		

What is the maximum percentage of wages that UK Employees in tier 3 areas can receive through the combination of the Job Support Scheme and Universal Credit?		
""Combine the Universal Credit with the Job Support Scheme that we've just announced and workers will be getting 80% of their existing salary,"" he said at Prime Minister's Questions on 21 October. Whether a worker gets Universal Credit on top of the job support scheme depends on a number of factors such as the level of their income, whether they have savings and whether they have children. When the prime minister made the claim on 16 October he specified that he was talking about those on low incomes - clearly those on higher incomes will not qualify for Universal Credit and may be above the £2,100 a month limit for the Job Support Scheme. It is certainly the case that some workers on low incomes will get at least 80% of their usual wages.
		

What is the maximum percentage of wages that UK Employees in tier 3 areas can receive through the combination of the Job Support Scheme and Universal Credit?		
In order to make the claim, the employee must work at least 33% of their usual hours for the job to be seen as ‘viable’ and therefore eligible under this scheme. The Government will then pay a third of the hours not worked (up to a cap), with the employer also contributing a third. The remaining unpaid third is effectively the employee’s contribution to the scheme. This means that an employee earns 77% of their normal wage where the Government contribution has not been capped. Please note that there is still some detail to be released by HMRC on what constitutes ‘usual pay’, particularly for those whose pay has changed since March to a new pay arrangement with their employers, and some of the finer details of how the Job Support Scheme will operate.
		

What is the maximum percentage of wages that UK Employees in tier 3 areas can receive through the combination of the Job Support Scheme and Universal Credit?		
This is important because the furlough scheme, which closes at the end of October, made sure such workers received 80% of their wages up to a maximum of £2,500. But the Job Support Scheme, which will replace it in November, will provide 67% of normal salary up to a maximum of £2,100 a month. Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham and several MPs have called for the support to be increased to 80%. But Boris Johnson claims that the addition of Universal Credit (UC) means that it is already worth 80%.
		

What is the maximum percentage of wages that UK Employees in tier 3 areas can receive through the combination of the Job Support Scheme and Universal Credit?		
In particular, people whose wages were low enough for them to qualify for Universal Credit before their employers were forced to close, are likely to get at least 80% of their wages. But it is also the case that some workers will get less than 80%. We asked the Department for Work and Pensions how the prime minister had reached this figure and were told: ""Those on low incomes getting the full entitlement [of Universal Credit] will receive at least 80% of their normal income."" The DWP said that the full entitlement meant the amount that you would get without reductions for having savings.

What does it pay? Until 4 May, employees receive up to 70% of their net income up to a maximum €21,400. Since 4 May the scheme has become more generous, paying an 85% subsidy up to €21,400. Will it need to be reformed? The Irish government has already signalled to employers that the scheme, which like the British scheme forces claimants to stay at home and not work, will be modified to allow for part-time worker subsidies.

What is the maximum percentage of wages that UK Employees in tier 3 areas can receive through the combination of the Job Support Scheme and Universal Credit?		
- The Government will support eligible businesses by paying two thirds of each employees’ salary (or 67%), up to a maximum of £2,100 a month. - Under the scheme, employers will not be required to contribute towards wages and only asked to cover NICS and pension contributions. Businesses will only be eligible to claim the grant while they are subject to restrictions and employees must be off work for a minimum of seven consecutive days. - The scheme will run for the same period as the standard JSS scheme (above). There is a review due in January.
		

What is the maximum percentage of wages that UK Employees in tier 3 areas can receive through the combination of the Job Support Scheme and Universal Credit?		
The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, has announced that the UK’s job retention scheme – under which the state now pays 80% of the gross wages (up to a £2,500 per month maximum) of one in four UK workers – is to be extended until the end of October. Sunak also said that employers would be asked to contribute towards the £14bn a month cost of the scheme, and that it would soon allow part-time work to help businesses reboot their trade. So how does the UK scheme compare with other countries? How much has it cost? Berlin expected it to cost more than €10bn (£8.8bn) at its relaunch in March, though it is likely to escalate.
		

What is the maximum percentage of wages that UK Employees in tier 3 areas can receive through the combination of the Job Support Scheme and Universal Credit?		
It will sit alongside the original job support scheme, which will pay 22% of the wages for workers in “viable” jobs on reduced hours, while companies must contribute 55%. It will also sit alongside the £1,000 job retention bonus, which is paid per worker and is designed to encourage firms to keep staff on payroll until at least January. The Treasury expects the cost of the scheme to be hundreds of millions of pounds a month, making the cost of the entire six-month package several billion pounds. The cost will depend on how many companies are legally forced to close their premises by the government, and on how many workers firms claim.
		

What is the maximum percentage of wages that UK Employees in tier 3 areas can receive through the combination of the Job Support Scheme and Universal Credit?		
The coronavirus job retention scheme – commonly known as the furlough scheme – is due to close at the end of October. It offered to cover up to 80% of staff wages, up to a cap of £2,500 a month although it required financial contributions from businesses from July onwards. The level of support was then steadily reduced over the summer to 60%, with a cap of £1,875, from the start of this month. The expansion of the job support scheme also does not require any contribution from employers, and provides support at a similar level.

Scientific American Created Confusion about 5G's Safety: Will They Clear It Up? Joel M.

This article was published in Scientific American’s former blog network and reflects the views of the author, not necessarily those of Scientific American In a recent opinion piece for Scientific American, Joel M. Moskowitz warned ofthe ostensible dangers of radio-frequency (RF) radiation, stating bluntly that 5G technology could be dangerous, causing cancers and untold harm. Moskowitz concluded by insisting readers join his fellow activists petitioning against the new technology. His piece has resonated with the anti-5G movement, generating heated discussion online—but, alas, it is one that pivots on fringe views and fatally flawed conjecture, attempting to circumvent scientific consensus with scaremongering.

“We should support the recommendations of the 250 scientists and medical doctors who signed the 5G Appeal that calls for an immediate moratorium on the deployment of 5G and demand that our government fund the research needed to adopt biologically-based exposure limits that protect our health and safety.” About two weeks later, Scientific American published an opinion piece that attacked me and my article: “Don’t Fall Prey to Scaremongering about 5G: Activists cite low-quality studies in arguing radio-frequency radiation is dangerous, but the weight of evidence shows no risk.” This piece was written by David Robert Grimes, a science writer, cancer researcher, and physicist.

The latest 5G wireless technology relies on the deployment of many more new antennas and transmitters that are clustered lower to the ground and closer to homes and schools. There has been even more limited research with respect to the health ramifications of 5G technology, and the FCC has thus far failed to adequately explain how they have determined 5G is safe.

5G is also safe. It's not terribly different from the electromagnetic radiation associated with wi-fi and cell phones. The New York Times published an excellent article titled, ""The 5G Health Hazard That Isn't,"" and CNET published a diagram depicting 5G's place in the electromagnetic spectrum. Note that it is located in the radio wave spectrum, close to the frequencies for cell phones, computers, microwaves, and satellites. Astrophysicist Dr. Ethan Siegel explained to me previously that ""three things must be considered to determine if a source of radiation is dangerous: (1) the energy per photon, (2) the total amount of energy, and (3) the ability of the exposed object to absorb the radiation.""

At the end-user, consumer level, even dozens of devices surrounding you — similar to the situation you'd experience in an office, classroom, or airport — impart a level of radiation that, based on energy concerns, ought to pose no threat at all. As Dr. Alex Berezow of the American Council on Science and Health states, the assumption that 5G is safe is already backed by the full suite of scientific studies. Only, he contends, ""[i]f sufficient evidence shows something to the contrary, then we should reconsider the status quo."" From a theoretical point of view, there's absolutely no reason to fear 5G technology, or WiFi radiation in any form.

We know that the radio wave spectrum, in general, is safe. There is a physical reason for it: The photons associated with this part of the electromagnetic spectrum are ""non-ionizing,"" which means that they do not have enough energy to break chemical bonds. We also use these devices at a low wattage (i.e., a low amount of total energy), which is why you can boil water in a microwave (which operates at 1,000 watts) but not with your wireless router (which operates at 1 watt). All together, we have no reason to believe that 5G is unsafe. So, SciAm published an article saying the exact opposite: It should be noted that the author, Joel Moskowitz, believes Wi-Fi is toxic, which is particularly ironic since he works at a university that deploys Wi-Fi everywhere on campus.

Suarez confirmed that the officer was in line to vote when the photo was taken and said he was unsure whether the officer was on duty at the time. “The City of Miami and the Miami Police Department do not support or endorse any candidate for political party or elected office,” Suarez said. “It is our mission to provide impartial police services to everyone regardless of political affiliation.”

Most Democrats support the wearing of masks, according to a poll conducted by researchers at the Pew Research Center. Most Republicans do not. The Republicans are following the lead of the president: Trump has been reluctant to wear a mask, saying that it did not seem right to wear one while he was receiving heads of state at the White House. He put a mask on in public for the first time during a visit to a military hospital earlier this month. The battle over masks has escalated during the final weeks of the campaign season. The general election is in November, and activists in both parties, Republican and Democrat, are working feverishly to ensure victory at the polls.

Steve Simeonidis, the chair of the Miami-Dade Democratic Party, was moving through the lobby of the Stephen P. Clark Government Center in downtown Miami around 10:30 a.m. when he spotted Officer Daniel Ubeda in a mask that read, ""TRUMP 2020; NO MORE BULLSHIT,"" walking toward the early voting site inside the county government building. Simeonidis told BuzzFeed News Ubeda got within 10 feet of people who were voting. Under Florida law, only voters, poll workers, official poll watchers, and other individuals approved by election supervisors are permitted to enter a polling place. No one is allowed to solicit voters inside or within 150 feet of the entrance to a voting site, and it is illegal under both state and federal laws to intimidate voters by any means.

A Facebook post said, ""The Trump family was disallowed from operating any charity in the State of New York because they stole from a kids cancer charity."" A lawsuit does seek to temporarily ban Donald Trump and his three eldest children from being part of charities in New York. The lawsuit relates to the Donald J. Trump Foundation, not to a kids cancer charity. The lawsuit alleges that Trump used charitable assets to pay off legal obligations of entities he controlled, to promote his hotels, to buy personal items, and to support his presidential election campaign. Trump’s son, Eric, led a foundation that raised money for kids with cancer, and that foundation has come under scrutiny over its own handling of funds.

A kids cancer charity. A kids cancer charity,"" said the Oct. 8 Facebook post that’s been shared more than 43,000 times. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. In June 2018, the New York Attorney General (then Barbara Underwood) filed a lawsuit against Trump and three of his adult children — Donald J. Trump, Jr., Ivanka Trump, and Eric F. Trump — and against the Donald J. Trump Foundation. The lawsuit claimed that for more than a decade, the foundation persistently violated state and federal laws related to charities in the state of New York.

And while donors to the Eric Trump Foundation were told their money was going to help sick kids, more than $500,000 was re-donated to other charities, many of which were connected to Trump family members or interests, including at least four groups that subsequently paid to hold golf tournaments at Trump courses. All of this seems to defy federal tax rules and state laws that ban self-dealing and misleading donors. It also raises larger questions about the Trump family dynamics and whether Eric and his brother, Don Jr., can be truly independent of their father. Especially since the person who specifically commanded that the for-profit Trump Organization start billing hundreds of thousands of dollars to the nonprofit Eric Trump Foundation, according to two people directly involved, was none other than the current president of the United States, Donald Trump.

Posts on social media falsely claim that the Trump family is “disallowed from operating ANY charity” in New York because they “stole from a kids cancer charity.” That inaccurately describes the outcome of a court case involving the Donald J. Trump Foundation, and conflates it with allegations about the Eric Trump Foundation. President Donald Trump’s namesake charitable foundation agreed to cease operations in late 2018 as part of an agreement with New York’s attorney general, who alleged that the nonprofit organization was improperly leveraged to further Trump’s business and political interests. A November court order resolved the lawsuit, and Trump ultimately paid a total of $2 million in damages to eight charities, which also received equal portions of the foundation’s remaining $1.8 million.

The allegations involving members of the Trump family and a children's cancer charity are separate from the New York lawsuit against the Trump Foundation that sought to bar some of the family from running charities in that state. Amato's viral tweet inappropriately conflated the two sets of allegations by claiming that the charity ban (which was requested by the New York attorney general, but not granted by the court) was the result of Trump family members ""stealing"" from a children's charity. Investigations by both the Associated Press in 2016 and Forbes in 2017 found that the Eric Trump Foundation had misled donors and mismanaged funds, funneling money into Trump-owned businesses or other charities linked to the Trump empire. ""A charity operated by one of Donald Trump’s sons flouts philanthropic standards by financially benefiting charities connected to the Trump family and members of the charity’s board, an Associated Press investigation shows.

""For more than a decade, the Donald J. Trump Foundation has operated in persistent violation of state and federal law governing New York State charities. This pattern of illegal conduct by the Foundation and its board members includes improper and extensive political activity, repeated and willful self-dealing transactions, and failure to follow basic fiduciary obligations or to implement even elementary corporate formalities required by law."" As a result, Underwood asked the New York State Supreme Court to ""dissolve the Foundation for its persistently illegal conduct, enjoin its board members from future service as a director of any not-for-profit authorized by New York law, to obtain restitution and penalties, and to direct the Foundation to cooperate with the Attorney General in the lawful distribution of its remaining assets to qualified charitable entities.""

The settlement, however, does not ban the Trump family from operating a charity in New York, as this original Facebook post claimed. A pending lawsuit against President Donald Trump and his three eldest children seeks to prevent them from temporarily being involved in charities in New York. But a Facebook post takes it further by claiming that the family has already been ""disallowed."" That hasn’t happened.

WFP officials said they could not comment on the survey’s findings until that happened. The World Food Program was established in 1961 at the urging of U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower to tackle humanitarian crises, from natural disasters to conflict. The United States is its largest donor, and the agency is traditionally led by an American national, who is appointed by the U.N. secretary-general and the director-general of the Food and Agriculture Organization. Beasley has sought to assure career staff that he is committed to making WFP a better place to work. Early last year, Beasley appointed a woman, Patricia “Kiko” Harvey, as the agency’s inspector general.

Bacterial Pneumonia Caused Most Deaths in 1918 Influenza Pandemic The majority of deaths during the influenza pandemic of 1918-1919 were not caused by the influenza virus acting alone, report researchers from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health. Instead, most victims succumbed to bacterial pneumonia following influenza virus infection. The pneumonia was caused when bacteria that normally inhabit the nose and throat invaded the lungs along a pathway created when the virus destroyed the cells that line the bronchial tubes and lungs. A future influenza pandemic may unfold in a similar manner, say the NIAID authors, whose paper in the Oct. 1 issue of The Journal of Infectious Diseases is now available online.

Published pathologic and/or bacteriologic findings from the 1918–1919 influenza pandemic Although the cause of influenza was disputed in 1918, there was almost universal agreement among experts [e.g., 20, 27–33] that deaths were virtually never caused by the unidentified etiologic agent itself, but resulted directly from severe secondary pneumonia caused by well-known bacterial “pneumopathogens” that colonized the upper respiratory tract (predominantly pneumococci, streptococci, and staphylococci). Without this secondary bacterial pneumonia, experts generally believed that most patients would have recovered [20]. In type, pattern, and case-fatality rate, influenza-associated bacterial pneumonia was typical of pneumonia that was endemic during periods when influenza was not prevalent [25, 28, 33, 34].

Does the 2008 paper co-authored by Dr. Anthony Fauci actually state that most deaths during the 1918-1919 Spanish Influenza pandemic were due to bacterial pneumonia caused by wearing masks?		
The Spanish flu pandemic of 1918-1919 was the deadliest pandemic in world history, infecting some 500 million people across the globe—roughly one-third of the population—and causing up to 50 million deaths, including some 675,000 deaths in the United States alone. The disease, caused by a new variant of the influenza virus, was spread in part by troop movements during World War I. Though the flu pandemic hit much of Europe during the war, news reports from Spain weren’t subject to wartime censorship, so the misnomer “Spanish flu” entered common usage. With no vaccines or effective treatments, the pandemic caused massive social disruption: Schools, theaters, churches and businesses were forced to close, citizens were ordered to wear masks and bodies piled up in makeshift morgues before the virus ended its deadly worldwide march in early 1920. Influenza, or flu, is a virus that attacks the respiratory system. The flu virus is highly contagious: When an infected person coughs, sneezes or talks, respiratory droplets are generated and transmitted into the air, and can then can be inhaled by anyone nearby.

The postmortem samples we examined from people who died of influenza during 1918–1919 uniformly exhibited severe changes indicative of bacterial pneumonia. Bacteriologic and histopathologic results from published autopsy series clearly and consistently implicated secondary bacterial pneumonia caused by common upper respiratory–tract bacteria in most influenza fatalities. The majority of deaths in the 1918–1919 influenza pandemic likely resulted directly from secondary bacterial pneumonia caused by common upper respiratory–tract bacteria. Less substantial data from the subsequent 1957 and 1968 pandemics are consistent with these findings.

In the most recent influenza pandemic that did not involve the use of antibiotics to suppress bacteria (the 1918–1919 pandemic), histological and bacteriologic evidence suggests that the vast majority of influenza deaths resulted from secondary bacterial pneumonia. Compelling evidence for this conclusion includes the examination of 58 recut and restained autopsy specimens that showed changes fully consistent with classical descriptions of extensive bacterial pneumonia [25], culture results from numerous international autopsy series, and consistent epidemiologic and clinical findings (table 3). |Most autopsies revealed severe bacterial pneumonia caused by common upper respiratory organisms |In type, pattern, and case-fatality rate, influenza-associated bacterial pneumonia, including chronic lobar pneumonia, was typical of pneumonia during periods when influenza was not prevalent; bronchopneumonia, associated with diffuse “panbronchitis,” predominated

Medical and scientific experts now agree that bacteria, not influenza viruses, were the greatest cause of death during the 1918 flu pandemic. Government efforts to gird for the next influenza pandemic – bird flu or otherwise – ought to take notice and stock up on antibiotics, says John Brundage, a medical microbiologist at the Armed Forces Health Surveillance Center in Silver Spring, Maryland. Brundage’s team culled first-hand accounts, medical records and infection patterns from 1918 and 1919. Although a nasty strain of flu virus swept around the world, bacterial pneumonia that came on the heels of mostly mild cases of flu killed the majority of the 20 to 100 million victims of the so-called Spanish flu, they conclude.

“We agree completely that bacterial pneumonia played a major role in the mortality of the 1918 pandemic,” says Anthony Fauci, director of National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Disease in Bethesda, Maryland, and author of another journal article out next month that comes to a similar conclusion. That pneumonia causes most deaths in an influenza outbreak is well known. Late 19th century physicians recognised pneumonia as the cause of death of most flu victims. While doctors limited fatalities in other 20th-century outbreaks with antibiotics such as penicillin, which was discovered in 1928, but did not see use in patients until 1942. This is not to say that flu viruses do nothing, says Jonathan McCullers, an expert on influenza-bacteria co-infections at St Jude Children’s Research Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee.

Bacterial Pneumonia Caused Most Deaths in 1918 Influenza Pandemic The majority of deaths during the influenza pandemic of 1918-1919 were not caused by the influenza virus acting alone, report researchers from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health. Instead, most victims succumbed to bacterial pneumonia following influenza virus infection. The pneumonia was caused when bacteria that normally inhabit the nose and throat invaded the lungs along a pathway created when the virus destroyed the cells that line the bronchial tubes and lungs. A future influenza pandemic may unfold in a similar manner, say the NIAID authors, whose paper in the Oct. 1 issue of The Journal of Infectious Diseases is now available online.

The Spanish flu pandemic of 1918-1919 was the deadliest pandemic in world history, infecting some 500 million people across the globe—roughly one-third of the population—and causing up to 50 million deaths, including some 675,000 deaths in the United States alone. The disease, caused by a new variant of the influenza virus, was spread in part by troop movements during World War I. Though the flu pandemic hit much of Europe during the war, news reports from Spain weren’t subject to wartime censorship, so the misnomer “Spanish flu” entered common usage. With no vaccines or effective treatments, the pandemic caused massive social disruption: Schools, theaters, churches and businesses were forced to close, citizens were ordered to wear masks and bodies piled up in makeshift morgues before the virus ended its deadly worldwide march in early 1920. Influenza, or flu, is a virus that attacks the respiratory system. The flu virus is highly contagious: When an infected person coughs, sneezes or talks, respiratory droplets are generated and transmitted into the air, and can then can be inhaled by anyone nearby.

In March 1976, following the botched 1976 military coup d'état attempt which led to the assassination of General Murtala Mohammed, his deputy General Olusegun Obasanjo became the military head of state and appointed Colonel Buhari as the Federal Commissioner for Petroleum and Natural Resources (now minister). In 1977, when the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation was created, Buhari was appointed as its chairman, a position he held until 1978.[42] During his tenure as the Federal Commissioner for Petroleum and Natural Resources, the government invested in pipelines and petroleum storage infrastructures. The government built about 21 petroleum storage depots all over the country from Lagos to Maiduguri and from Calabar to Gusau; the administration constructed a pipeline network that connected Bonny terminal and the Port Harcourt refinery to the depots.

China-Taiwan tensions erupt over diplomats' fight in Fiji Longstanding tensions between China and Taiwan have erupted over a physical fight between their diplomats in Fiji. Taiwan alleges two Chinese embassy officials gate-crashed an event to celebrate their national day earlier this month - claims Beijing disputes. Both sides say their officials were injured in the fight, and have asked Fiji police to investigate.
		

Is there credible and verified evidence, such as eyewitness accounts, video footage, or official reports, documenting an incident where Chinese diplomats assaulted their Taiwanese counterparts in Fiji?		
Taiwanese staff confronted the officials and a fight broke out, with one Taiwanese official injured severely enough that he required treatment at hospital for head injuries, Taiwan’s ministry and multiple sources at the scene said. Police were called to the hotel but sources have told the Guardian the Chinese officials claimed diplomatic immunity. Taiwan accused the Chinese officials of falsely telling Fijian police they had been attacked by the Taiwanese personnel and said it “strongly condemned the serious violations of the rule of law and civilised norms by the staff of the Chinese embassy in Fiji.” But in a regular press briefing in Beijing, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said the reports were “completely inconsistent” with the facts and that one of its own embassy staff in Suva had been injured.

In its statement Monday, the Chinese embassy in Fiji said that Taiwan was an “inalienable part of China’s territory” and criticized the function celebrating Taiwan’s National Day for “clearly (violating) the one-China principle.” Taiwan Foreign Ministry spokesperson Ou said that the two Chinese officials who entered the event on October 8 were later “forcibly taken away from the scene by the Fiji police.” CNN has reached out to Fiji’s police for comment but has yet to receive a response. The Taiwan Ministry of Foreign Affairs said it had asked the injured official and the Taiwan representative office in Fiji to submit witness testimony and physical evidence to the Fiji police and foreign ministry to “ensure a correct understanding of the situation.”

Is there credible and verified evidence, such as eyewitness accounts, video footage, or official reports, documenting an incident where Chinese diplomats assaulted their Taiwanese counterparts in Fiji?		
A physical altercation between Chinese and Taiwanese diplomats in Fiji has left a Taiwanese official in hospital with a head injury and again highlighted tensions between Beijing and Taipei in their struggle for influence across the Pacific. In furious statements on Monday the rival foreign ministries accused each other’s diplomats of attacking their Fiji-based staff at a reception marking Taiwan’s national day on 8 October at hotel in the capital, Suva. Beijing considers Taiwan to be a part of China, and is highly sensitive to any apparent recognition of Taiwanese sovereignty by other governments, such as supporting National Day celebrations. Taiwan’s ministry of foreign affairs said two Chinese embassy officials arrived at the Grand Pacific hotel uninvited and began “harassing” and trying to photograph the guests which included Fijian ministers, foreign diplomats, NGO representatives and members of Fiji’s ethnic Chinese community.

A Taiwan official was allegedly injured after becoming involved in a physical altercation with two Chinese diplomats at a function in Fiji earlier this month, according to Taiwan’s Foreign Ministry. The incident occurred on October 8 during a celebration for Taiwan’s National Day at the island’s representative office in Fiji’s capital city of Suva, Taiwan Foreign Ministry spokesperson Joanne Ou told CNN on Monday. Ou said that officials from the Chinese embassy in Fiji attempted to “gatecrash” the venue to take photos of the guests attending the event. The two Chinese officials then became “violent when dissuaded by our staff, causing head injuries to our (official) who was later sent to hospital,” Ou said.

The Taiwanese diplomat who asked them to leave was assaulted and needed hospital treatment for a head injury, the ministry said. ""We strongly condemn the actions by the Chinese embassy in Fiji staff for seriously violating the rule of law and civilised code of conduct,"" Taiwan foreign ministry spokeswoman Joanne Ou said. China gave a different account of events. Its embassy in Fiji said its staff had been in a ""public area outside the function venue"" carrying out unspecified ""official duties"" and accused Taiwanese officials of acted ""provocatively"" and causing ""injuries and damage to one Chinese diplomat"". China's foreign ministry, in a briefing on Monday, revealed its officials were aware of what was happening inside the venue, including the fact there was a cake featuring the Taiwanese flag, which Beijing describes as false because it does not recognise Taiwan as a country.

He claimed Fiji “expressed that it attaches great importance to China’s concerns and will abide by the ‘one China principle’ and handle the incident appropriately.” An earlier statement from China’s embassy in Suva, reiterated by Zhao, said the staff of the Taipei trade office in Fiji had “acted provocatively against the Chinese embassy staff who were carrying out their official duties in the public area outside the function venue, causing injuries and damage to one Chinese diplomat”. A spokeswoman for the Fiji police said a complaint had been lodged by the Chinese embassy against a Taiwanese official, alleging Chinese diplomats were assaulted when they tried to enter the venue. Taiwan’s trade office in Suva has meanwhile lodged an official note of protest with the Fiji ministry of foreign affairs and trade, and has also requested Fiji police investigate the incident and strengthen security for Taiwanese diplomats.
		

Is there credible and verified evidence, such as eyewitness accounts, video footage, or official reports, documenting an incident where Chinese diplomats assaulted their Taiwanese counterparts in Fiji?		
She didn’t say whether the official had been released from hospital yet. In a statement Monday, China’s embassy in Fiji disputed Ou’s version of events, contending instead that Taiwan officials had been “acting provocatively against the Chinese embassy staff, who were carrying out their official duties in a public area outside the function venue.” The embassy said that one Chinese diplomat had been injured in the altercation outside Fiji’s Grand Pacific Hotel. Ou said the Chinese officials’ account was “an attempt to reverse the truth and confuse the public.”
		

Is there credible and verified evidence, such as eyewitness accounts, video footage, or official reports, documenting an incident where Chinese diplomats assaulted their Taiwanese counterparts in Fiji?		
Zhao said Taiwan was attempting to cover up its misdeeds by blaming others and said it was a “thief crying ‘stop thief’.” In response to a question from a reporter regarding a fight between diplomats, Zhao replied: “First of all, Taiwan does not have any so-called diplomats in Fiji.” He said the event was a “serious violation of the one-China policy” and has requested Fiji investigate after it expressed serious concerns to the government. “The facts are that the Taiwan trade office openly held a ‘national day’ event and openly displayed the flag of a ‘false country’ and had that false country flag on a cake as well,” Zhao said.

In 2018, Greenfield attempted to run for Congress in Iowa’s third congressional district. However, after her campaign tried to submit fraudulently collected signatures, she failed to collect a sufficient number of new signatures to appear on the ballot.

Joe Biden’s first year in the private sector proved to be his most lucrative in at least two decades. He and his wife, Jill, earned about $11.1 million in 2017, nearly double their total earnings from 1998 to 2016, which added up to $5.8 million, according to a Forbes analysis of tax returns. The couple brought in another $4.6 million last year. The bulk of the Bidens’ big payday came from a book deal and speaking engagements. Joe Biden routed his book and speaking payments through a company named CelticCapri Corp., which took in $9.5 million in 2017 and $2.7 million in 2018.

WASHINGTON – “Middle Class Joe” is now rolling in dough. Former Vice President Joe Biden and wife, Jill, raked in more than $15.6 million in the two years since leaving the White House, according to newly released financial disclosure forms. That’s a huge jump from 2016 when the Bidens’ income was just under $397,000 in the final year of the Obama administration. Most of the financial windfall — $13.3 million – came from revenues from the Bidens’ two books and from speaking fees.
		

What are the most recent verified income figures for Joe and Jill Biden, and how do they compare to their income from previous years?		
So the Bidens together exceeded the $400,000 threshold by several thousand dollars once, in 2013, and by much larger amounts twice, in 2017 and 2018. (Their 2019 tax return has not yet been made public.) This pattern makes sense: As a senator and later as vice president, Joe Biden’s salary was fixed by law, and Jill Biden worked in teaching. As vice president, Biden earned up to $230,700 a year, and as a senator his annual salary varied from $44,600 when he began serving in the Senate in 1973 to $169,300 by the time he left the chamber in January 2009.
		

What are the most recent verified income figures for Joe and Jill Biden, and how do they compare to their income from previous years?		
The couple reported about $11 million in adjusted gross income in 2017, the documents from 2016 through 2018 show. They followed it up with another $4.6 million in adjusted gross income last year. Their income spiked from about $396,000 in 2016. The Bidens paid about $3.7 million and $1.5 in taxes for 2017 and 2018, respectively — about a third of their adjusted gross income. They gave roughly $1 million and $275,000 to charity in 2017 and 2018, respectively.
		

What are the most recent verified income figures for Joe and Jill Biden, and how do they compare to their income from previous years?		
Joint income between Biden and his wife Jill rose from $215,000 to $249,000 between 1998 and 2006. These numbers reflect the total of Joe Biden's Senate salary, his Widener University School of Law teaching salary, and Jill Biden's teaching salary. The Bidens give little to charity. 2007, in which they donated $995, was their most generous year, though in other years Biden donated honoraria from talk shows which were valued at higher amounts. The Bidens make almost no money each year from dividends or interest. They deduct only state/local taxes, mortgage interest and what he donates to charity. 2003 was the last year they claimed a dependent child -- their daughter, Ashley.

77,A third of excess deaths in the United States between 1 March and  1 August 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic could not be directly attributed to the coronavirus,"What official statistics or studies specifically quantify and analyze the proportion of excess deaths during that period in the United States that were directly attributed to COVID-19 versus those that could not be directly attributed to it?		
Although total US death counts are remarkably consistent from year to year, US deaths increased by 20% during March-July 2020. COVID-19 was a documented cause of only 67% of these excess deaths. Some states had greater difficulty than others in containing community spread, causing protracted elevations in excess deaths that extended into the summer. US deaths attributed to some noninfectious causes increased during COVID-19 surges. Excess deaths attributed to causes other than COVID-19 could reflect deaths from unrecognized or undocumented infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 or deaths among uninfected patients resulting from disruptions produced by the pandemic. Study limitations include the reliance on provisional data, inaccuracies in death certificates, and assumptions applied to the model.
		

What official statistics or studies specifically quantify and analyze the proportion of excess deaths during that period in the United States that were directly attributed to COVID-19 versus those that could not be directly attributed to it?		
Previous studies of excess deaths (the gap between observed and expected deaths) during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic found that publicly reported COVID-19 deaths underestimated the full death toll, which includes documented and undocumented deaths from the virus and non–COVID-19 deaths caused by disruptions from the pandemic.1,2 A previous analysis found that COVID-19 was cited in only 65% of excess deaths in the first weeks of the pandemic (March-April 2020); deaths from non–COVID-19 causes (eg, Alzheimer disease, diabetes, heart disease) increased sharply in 5 states with the most COVID-19 deaths.1 This study updates through August 1, 2020, the estimate of excess deaths and explores temporal relationships with state reopenings (lifting of coronavirus restrictions). Death data for 2014-2020 and population counts for the 50 states and the District of Columbia were obtained from the National Center for Health Statistics3,4 and US Census Bureau,5 respectively. Death counts from March 1, 2020, through August 1, 2020, were taken from provisional, unweighted data released on September 9, 2020.3 Connecticut and North Carolina were excluded due to missing data. A hierarchical Poisson regression model, described elsewhere,1 was used to predict expected deaths based on historic norms.
		

What official statistics or studies specifically quantify and analyze the proportion of excess deaths during that period in the United States that were directly attributed to COVID-19 versus those that could not be directly attributed to it?		
In 14 states, more than 50% of excess deaths were attributed to underlying causes other than COVID-19; these included California (55% of excess deaths) and Texas (64% of excess deaths) (Table). The 5 states with the most COVID-19 deaths experienced large proportional increases in deaths due to nonrespiratory underlying causes, including diabetes (96%), heart diseases (89%), Alzheimer disease (64%), and cerebrovascular diseases (35%) (Figure). New York City experienced the largest increases in nonrespiratory deaths, notably those due to heart disease (398%) and diabetes (356%). These estimates suggest that the number of COVID-19 deaths reported in the first weeks of the pandemic captured only two-thirds of excess deaths in the US.
		

What official statistics or studies specifically quantify and analyze the proportion of excess deaths during that period in the United States that were directly attributed to COVID-19 versus those that could not be directly attributed to it?		
Potential explanations include delayed reporting of COVID-19 deaths and misattribution of COVID-19 deaths to other respiratory illnesses (eg, pneumonia) or to nonrespiratory causes reflecting complications of COVID-19 (eg, coagulopathy, myocarditis). Few excess deaths involved pneumonia or influenza as underlying causes. This study has limitations, including the reliance on provisional data, potentially inaccurate death certificates, and modeling assumptions. For example, modeling epidemiologic years instead of calendar years would reduce the excess deaths estimate to 73 524.
		

What official statistics or studies specifically quantify and analyze the proportion of excess deaths during that period in the United States that were directly attributed to COVID-19 versus those that could not be directly attributed to it?		
The number of publicly reported deaths from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) may underestimate the pandemic’s death toll. Such estimates rely on provisional data that are often incomplete and may omit undocumented deaths from COVID-19. Moreover, restrictions imposed by the pandemic (eg, stay-at-home orders) could claim lives indirectly through delayed care for acute emergencies, exacerbations of chronic diseases, and psychological distress (eg, drug overdoses). This study estimated excess deaths in the early weeks of the pandemic and the relative contribution of COVID-19 and other causes.
		

What official statistics or studies specifically quantify and analyze the proportion of excess deaths during that period in the United States that were directly attributed to COVID-19 versus those that could not be directly attributed to it?		
Weekly death data for the 50 US states and the District of Columbia were obtained from the National Center for Health Statistics for January through April 2020 and the preceding 6 years (2014-2019).1,2 US totals excluded Connecticut and North Carolina because of missing data. The analysis included total deaths and deaths from COVID-19, influenza/pneumonia, heart disease, diabetes, and 10 other grouped causes (Supplement). Mortality rates for causes other than COVID-19 were available only for underlying causes. Death data with any mention of COVID-19 on the death certificate (as an underlying or contributing cause) were used to capture all deaths attributed to the virus. Population counts for calculating mortality rates were obtained from the US Census Bureau.3,4
		

What official statistics or studies specifically quantify and analyze the proportion of excess deaths during that period in the United States that were directly attributed to COVID-19 versus those that could not be directly attributed to it?		
COVID-19 deaths included those in which COVID-19 was cited as an underlying or contributing cause. Data for deaths not attributed to COVID-19 were only available for underlying causes of death, including Alzheimer disease, heart disease, and 10 other grouped causes, defined elsewhere.1 Reopening dates were obtained from the New York Times.6 To confirm the validity of observed increases in non–COVID-19 deaths, the Joinpoint regression program (version 4.8.0.1; Statistical Research and Applications Branch, National Cancer Institute) was used to specify the weeks (joinpoints) when slopes changed (as measured by the annual percentage change [APC]) and their statistical significance (2-sided test, .05 threshold). To estimate dispersion in the epidemic curve for each state, the number of consecutive weeks during which 90% of excess deaths occurred (ED90) was calculated. All calculations were performed in SAS (version 9.4; SAS Institute) and R (version 3.6.1; The R Foundation).
		

What official statistics or studies specifically quantify and analyze the proportion of excess deaths during that period in the United States that were directly attributed to COVID-19 versus those that could not be directly attributed to it?		
It is important to note that the excess cumulative numbers of natural deaths include more than direct and indirect COVID-19 deaths. In particular, they include deaths arising from constraints on health resources. It is also important to point out that the excess deaths are classified by date of occurrence of the death while the confirmed COVID-19 deaths are classified by date of reporting by the Ministry of Health. Factors that may contribute to observed excess deaths include: - People dying from COVID-19 before they get to the health care facility. This may be due to lack of transport, delays in transport and/or hospitals being unable to receive them.
		

What official statistics or studies specifically quantify and analyze the proportion of excess deaths during that period in the United States that were directly attributed to COVID-19 versus those that could not be directly attributed to it?		
Between March 1 and August 1, 2020, 1 336 561 deaths occurred in the US, a 20% increase over expected deaths (1 111 031 [95% CI, 1 110 364 to 1 111 697]). The 10 states with the highest per capita rate of excess deaths were New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Louisiana, Arizona, Mississippi, Maryland, Delaware, Rhode Island, and Michigan. The states with the highest per capita rate of excess deaths changed from week to week (Video). The increase in absolute deaths in these states relative to expected values ranged from 22% in Rhode Island and Michigan to 65% in New York (Table). Three states with the highest death rates (New Jersey, New York, and Massachusetts) accounted for 30% of US excess deaths but had the shortest epidemics (ED90 < 10 weeks).
		

What official statistics or studies specifically quantify and analyze the proportion of excess deaths during that period in the United States that were directly attributed to COVID-19 versus those that could not be directly attributed to it?		
To explore increases in cause-specific mortality in jurisdictions overwhelmed by COVID-19, mortality trends for 14 grouped causes (4 reported here) were examined in the 5 states with the most COVID-19 deaths from March through April 2020 (Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania). Deaths in these states peaked in the week ending on April 11, 2020, and the proportional increase above baseline (weighted mean of weekly deaths over 9 weeks in January to February 2020) was measured. All calculations were performed using SAS, version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc). Between March 1, 2020, and April 25, 2020, a total of 505 059 deaths were reported in the US; 87 001 (95% CI, 86 578-87 423) were excess deaths, of which 56 246 (65%) were attributed to COVID-19.

Pizzagate is a conspiracy that grew in popularity during the 2016 presidential race and it suggested that a Pizzeria in Washington DC known as Comet Ping Pong was the home of a child sex ring run by Hillary Clinton along with her campaign manager John Podesta and many other democrats. There are many variations of this conspiracy, but it is centered around many people involved in the Democratic Party being responsible for a large governmental child sex ring which intends to sexually abuse small children and sell them into sex trafficking as part of the New World Order. This conspiracy gained significant media attention after a man named Edgar Welch travelled from North Carolina to Washington DC with an assault rifle, in order to confront the employees of the store. The origins of the conspiracy are unknown but they seem to have began in October of 2016 after several Twitter users claimed that former democratic congressman Anthony Weiner’s computer was recovered by the FBI and that there is evidence on that laptop that Weiner was involved in a child sexual abuse.

Here’s everything to know about Pizzagate—the fake news story that has spun out of control, leading to trolling, protests and now an arrest: The allegation, which is false, is that Hillary and Bill Clinton used the Comet Ping Pong pizza restaurant in Washington, D.C., as a front for a pedophile sex ring; the back room was supposedly used for kidnapping and trafficking children. Pizzagate began after James Alefantis, the owner of Comet Ping Pong and a notable Democratic donor, was mentioned in Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta’s emails, released by WikiLeaks earlier this year.

The operators of the pizza shop began receiving threats from right wing activists who believed that the reports were true. According to The Washington Post, the trigger was the announcement on October 28 about the resumption of the investigation by the Federal Bureau of investigation (“FBI”) into the issue of the use of private e-mail by Hillary Clinton during her tenure as Secretary of State. Two days later, there was a large volume of tweets about newly-discovered e-mail related to a pedophile sex ring.

I Googled “#pizzagate” and read of an alarming theory, alleging that a child sex trafficking ring was being run out of the basement of a DC pizza parlor called Comet Ping Pong. Apparently the theory was born from the same hacked and leaked e-mails of Hillary Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta, which had just played a role in the recent presidential election, and continue to make headlines. It seems a string of e-mails between Podesta and the owner of Comet Ping Pong, James Alefantis, regarding a Clinton fundraiser, somehow led to allegations that Podesta and the Clinton’s were involved in an occult cabal supplying child slaves to be sold through secret rooms in the pizza place.

The ""pizzagate"" conspiracy theory included the baseless claims that Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and her top associates were running a demonic sex-trafficking ring inside the pizza shop. Jones promoted the theory on his web site and on social media.

After Podesta’s emails were hacked (likely by Russian agents) and WikiLeaks published them, 4chan users in October found emails between Podesta and Alefantis about a Clinton fundraiser that happened early in the campaign. From there, people began speculating without any evidence that the restaurant was part of a broader child trafficking ring run by the Democratic Party — a popular but entirely false conspiracy theory on the fringes of conservative media. The conspiracy theories jumped over to Reddit, where the popular Trump subreddit r/The_Donald championed it; Twitter, where pro-Trump tweeters (including the son of Trump’s pick for national security adviser) have continued to promote it; and Facebook, where fake news outlets have written and shared articles about it. And Alex Jones, the head of the fake news InfoWars who once argued that President Barack Obama and Clinton are literally demons, also boosted the conspiracy theory, saying on his show (in a video that was published in early November but later taken down) that “Hillary Clinton has personally murdered children.”

Has there been any credible evidence or investigation confirming that Anthony Weiner's laptop contained proof implicating Hillary Clinton or her associates in child trafficking or paedophilia?		
However it got into the hands of law enforcement, the Weiner laptop computer could contain a virtual treasure trove of important evidence relating to the investigation into whether Hillary Clinton mishandled classified information. The evidentiary possibilities are almost infinite. Not surprisingly, so-called ESD’s (electronic storage devices"" such as laptop and desktop computers, company servers, individual smartphones and tablets and any other hard drive, thumb drive or virtual storage contraption or facility) have time and again provided law enforcement with the 21st century equivalent of the proverbial smoking gun. In Weiner’s case, his alleged illicit sexting and possible unlawful relationship with a minor has accidentally engulfed Hillary Clinton – because his device contained “active data” such as actual emails or perhaps email headers or other related cache pertaining to Clinton’s role as Secretary of State or her role in any other possible criminal undertaking or conspiracy, including obstruction of justice. But the evidentiary possibilities do not stop there. The “active data” on the Weiner laptop computer will not only contain exculpatory or inculpatory email communications and other relevant data.

But the bias didn’t help Clinton. It destroyed her. On Sept. 26, 2016, as part of a sex crimes investigation, an FBI agent in New York found hundreds of thousands of emails on a laptop belonging to former Rep. Anthony Weiner, who was married at the time to Huma Abedin, a top Clinton aide. Two days later, the head of the New York FBI office told dozens of FBI executives, including Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, that the laptop had 140,000 emails possibly relevant to the Clinton investigation.

FBI Obtains Warrant Needed to Start Reviewing Emails Found on Laptop Used by Clinton Aide Emails were on laptop used by Huma Abedin and husband Anthony Weiner. — -- Federal investigators looking into the Hillary Clinton email matter have obtained a warrant needed to start reviewing the emails found on a laptop used by Clinton aide Huma Abedin and her husband, Anthony Weiner. FBI Director James Comey told Congress Friday that the agency was again reviewing emails related to Clinton's personal server after it learned of additional information that might be relevant to the case.

The FBI has previously said that a number of Abedin's documents were backed up on Weiner's laptop It was likely that some of the emails stored on Weiner's laptop contained classified information The State Department posted a number of emails belonging to former top Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin on Friday after the messages were found on Anthony Weiner’s laptop by the FBI. Several of the released documents were found to contain information classified “confidential,” and were heavily redacted.

Out of the 650,000 emails found on former congressman Anthony Weiner's laptop, only a small number will likely be related to that case, a law enforcement official familiar with the investigation into emails related to the probe of Hillary Clinton's private server told NBC News on Monday. The emails, uncovered during the FBI’s separate investigation into Weiner’s alleged illicit communications with an underage girl, are connected to Weiner's estranged wife, top Clinton aide Huma Abedin, and ended up on the same laptop.

In October 2016, Hagmann claimed, he “communicated” with a friend who knows someone affiliated with the NYPD. The friend of the friend had been on the “task force” that secured Weiner’s computer and had copied documents onto a thumb drive “proving” Clinton and her associates were involved in pedophilia. “Now, I can’t get him to give me the thumb drive,” he said. “Or even admit to the fact that he had it.” When I asked how he knew the files existed, he said, “I trust my source.”

ProPublica’s detailed examination of how then FBI Director James Comey handled — and mishandled — the entire Clinton investigation noted that the bureau’s top hierarchy, including Comey, was alerted to the discovery of the Clinton emails within days. On Sept. 26, after federal prosecutors in New York obtained a search warrant, the FBI collected Weiner’s iPhone, iPad and laptop. Agents began examining the computer — a silver, 15.6-inch 2015 Dell Inspiron 7000 — for any pictures, videos or other evidence involving Weiner’s teenage sexting partner. An agent sorting through the contents of the hard drive came across a jolting find: a State Department memo and some emails between Abedin and Hillary Clinton.

Has there been any credible evidence or investigation confirming that Anthony Weiner's laptop contained proof implicating Hillary Clinton or her associates in child trafficking or paedophilia?		
It appears that the Weiner laptop computer came to be in the FBI's possession when, on October 3, 2016, New York FBI agents executed a search warrant to obtain Weiner’s iPhone, an iPad and the laptop. However, given that the Clinton/Abedin emails were not within the scope of the original search warrant (which was likely limited to data pertaining to Weiner’s alleged illicit relationship, sexting and other related conduct), it also appears that the FBI had not read, analyzed or perhaps even seen the actual Clinton/Abedin emails on the Weiner laptop computer. What predictably ensued was a frantic weekend where the U.S. Department of Justice reportedly applied for a search warrant for the Abedin/Clinton emails, which was apparently authorized by a federal judge, and a review of the reported 650,000 emails has begun. The review will likely entail: 1) de-duping of any identical emails in the batch; 2) an electronic review via key word search or other similar methodology of the remaining emails or other data; and 3) a forensic analysis of the hard drive for any relevant remnants, artifacts, fragments or residue from any deleted or otherwise trashed emails.

What is the origin and history of the term ""red-tagging,"" and which groups or individuals are credited with its invention?		
The term Red has been used as an informal and offensive label for Communists or Socialists. It references the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, geographically the largest country in the world from 1922 to 1991. The Soviet flag was red, designed with a gold hammer, sickle and star in its upper left corner. The CPP and its armed wing, the New People’s Army (NPA) was listed as a foreign terrorist organization in the United States in 2002. On Dec. 5, 2017, President Rodrigo Duterte declared the CPP-NPA a terrorist organization.
		

What is the origin and history of the term ""red-tagging,"" and which groups or individuals are credited with its invention?		
In 1973, a commission created by the CPP-NPA founded the National Democratic Front of the Philippines (NDF or NDFP). Attempting to unify and coordinate various leftist groups, the NDF served as an umbrella organization for the CPP-NPA and other mass revolutionary organizations. Media and academic sources have sometimes described the NDF as the CPP-NPA’s political wing, since the CPP-NPA was still illegal under Republic Act No. 1700. The CPP-NPA dominated and led the NDF. The Philippine government, among others, has used the name “CPP-NPA-NDF” or “CNN” to refer to the larger entity formed through the cooperation of the CPP-NPA and the NDF.[16]

Explaining the Sustainability of the Communist Party of the Philippines-New People’s Army The Government of the Republic of the Philippines (GRP) is confronted by a persistent communist insurgency, the origins of which date back to 1968, when the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) announced its loyalty to the Maoist precept of “people’s war” and mobilized its devoted military wing, the New People’s Army (NPA). The CPP-NPA started with a small group of students and workers convened by Jose Maria Sison, a university lecturer who was profoundly influenced by the theoretical foundations of Marxism-Leninism. The Third World fusion of peasant unrest and nationalism marked by a series of events in the 1960s such as the Vietnam War, the perceived inequities in the relationship between the Philippines and the United States, oppression resulting in social inequalities, the political radicalism that was sweeping university campuses around the world, and the Cultural Revolution in the People’s Republic of China, further influenced the creation of the militant organization.
		

What is the origin and history of the term ""red-tagging,"" and which groups or individuals are credited with its invention?		
Because the party and its armed wing are so closely intertwined, they are often referred to together as the CPP-NPA.[3] The CPP-NPA was established by Jose Maria Sison, a popular former student activist. Sison previously led a Maoist-oriented youth faction within the Partido Komunista ng Pilipinas (PKP), which was established in 1930. For decades, the PKP participated in electoral boycotts and used a guerrilla army to fight Japanese colonialism, U.S. colonialism, and Filipino elites. In 1957, Republic Act No. 1700 banned the PKP and any of its successors, which would later include the CPP-NPA from participating in politics.

The Philippines have been defined by a series of center-periphery and often ideologically Maoist, separatist insurgencies. The Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP), began its war against the central Philippine government in 1968 through their armed wing – the New People’s Army (NPA). Further legitimacy was gained through the establishment of the National Democratic Front (NDF) in 1973. Grievances were predominantly opposed to the corruption and repression under the authoritarian Marcos regime.

Welker comes from an established Democratic family — who have poured cash into party coffers, and to Trump opponents, for years. Her mother, Julie Welker, a prominent real estate broker in Philadelphia, and father, Harvey Welker, a consulting engineer, have donated tens of thousands of dollars to Democratic candidates and close to $20,000 to Barack Obama alone. There was also $3,300 for Joe Biden’s 2020 campaign and $2,100 for Hillary Clinton’s doomed 2016 presidential effort against Trump. Another $7,300 was contributed to the Democratic National Committee between 2004 and 2020.

Though Kristen Welker’s party registration is not listed today, she was a registered Democrat in Washington, DC, in 2012 and in Rhode Island in 2004. Throughout Welker’s tenure as a White House correspondent, she has earned a reputation for a scathing style of questioning. “Mr. President, yes or no. … have you ever worked for Russia.

The treatment stands in stark contrast to her handling of Democratic politicos. In March 2016 Welker was busted on live television tipping off Hillary Clinton’s Communications Director Jennifer Palmieri about at least one question she planned to ask her during a post-debate interview in Michigan. At the time Clinton was locked in a fierce fight for the Democratic nomination against Sen.

But Welker has been at NBC since 2010. In 2011, she became a White House correspondent, later being promoted to Weekend TODAY co-anchor in January 2020, due to her incredible coverage of the NBC News' 2016 campaign. That time @kwelkernbc (an already amazing journalist) became a legend. pic.twitter.com/FhxiJp9ATw Trump's disdain towards the media, primarily NBC News, is nothing new.

Here are a few other interesting facts about Welker we can't stop obsessing over. Although Welker makes history has the second Black woman to moderate a presidential debate solo, this isn't her first time moderating. Last November, Welker co-moderated a Democratic primary presidential debate alongside MSNBC's Rachel Maddow, NBC's Andrea Mitchell, and Washington Post's Ashley Parker. That particular debate included former Vice President Joe Biden and California Sen. Kamala Harris. So it's safe to say Welker knows what she's doing.

This report describes trends and demographic patterns in the number of excess deaths occurring in the United States from January 26, 2020, through October 3, 2020, and differences by age and race/ethnicity using provisional mortality data from the NVSS.§ Excess deaths are typically defined as the number of persons who have died from all causes, in excess of the expected number of deaths for a given place and time. A detailed description of the methodology for estimating excess deaths has been described previously (7). Briefly, expected numbers of deaths are estimated using overdispersed Poisson regression models with spline terms to account for seasonal patterns.

As of October 15, 216,025 deaths from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been reported in the United States*; however, this number might underestimate the total impact of the pandemic on mortality. Measures of excess deaths have been used to estimate the impact of public health pandemics or disasters, particularly when there are questions about underascertainment of deaths directly attributable to a given event or cause (1–6).† Excess deaths are defined as the number of persons who have died from all causes, in excess of the expected number of deaths for a given place and time. This report describes trends and demographic patterns in excess deaths during January 26–October 3, 2020.

What statistical data or studies exist that analyze the correlation between US lockdown measures and excess deaths not directly attributed to COVID-19 during 2020?		
Estimates of excess deaths can provide a comprehensive account of mortality related to the COVID-19 pandemic, including deaths that are directly or indirectly attributable to COVID-19. Estimates of the numbers of deaths directly attributable to COVID-19 might be limited by factors such as the availability and use of diagnostic testing (including postmortem testing) and the accurate and complete reporting of cause of death information on the death certificate. Excess death analyses are not subject to these limitations because they examine historical trends in all-cause mortality to determine the degree to which observed numbers of deaths differ from historical norms. In April 2020, CDC’s National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) began publishing data on excess deaths associated with the COVID-19 pandemic (7,8).
		

What statistical data or studies exist that analyze the correlation between US lockdown measures and excess deaths not directly attributed to COVID-19 during 2020?		
These analyses use publicly available aggregate data and were deemed exempt from human subjects review by the Yale institutional review board (protocol 1411014890). To calculate the number of excess deaths, we first needed to estimate the baseline number of deaths in the absence of COVID-19. We then subtracted the expected number of deaths in each week from the observed number of deaths for the period March 1, 2020, to May 30, 2020. Each of the 48 states (excluding North Carolina and Connecticut) and the District of Columbia were analyzed individually.

In comparison, there were an estimated 122 300 (95% prediction interval, 116 800-127 000) excess deaths during the same period (Table). The deaths officially attributed to COVID-19 accounted for 78% of the excess all-cause deaths, leaving 22% unattributed to COVID-19. The proportion of excess deaths that were attributed to COVID-19 varied between states and increased over time (Table and Figure 1). The changes in mortality that occurred during the pandemic varied by state and region. In New York City, all-cause mortality rose 7-fold above baseline at the peak of the pandemic, for a total of 25 100 (95%prediction interval, 24 800-25 400) excess deaths, of which 26% were unattributed to COVID-19 (Table and Figure 2).

The excess deaths methodology has been used to quantify official undercounting of deaths for many pathogens, including pandemic influenza viruses and HIV.7-9 In this study, we estimate the excess deaths due to any cause in each week of the COVID-19 pandemic across the United States. We compare these estimates of excess deaths with the reported numbers of deaths due to COVID-19 in different states and evaluate the timing of these increases in relation to testing and pandemic intensity. These analyses provide insights into the burden of COVID-19 in the early months of the outbreak in the United States and serve as a surveillance platform that can be updated as new data accrue.

Weekly numbers of deaths by age group and race/ethnicity were assessed to examine the difference between the weekly number of deaths occurring in 2020 and the average number occurring in the same week during 2015–2019 and the percentage change in 2020. Overall, an estimated 299,028 excess deaths have occurred in the United States from late January through October 3, 2020, with two thirds of these attributed to COVID-19. The largest percentage increases were seen among adults aged 25–44 years and among Hispanic or Latino (Hispanic) persons. These results provide information about the degree to which COVID-19 deaths might be underascertained and inform efforts to prevent mortality directly or indirectly associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, such as efforts to minimize disruptions to health care.

Pennsylvania, one of the most hotly contested battlegrounds in the presidential election, has rejected 372,000 requests for mail-in ballots, straining election offices and bewildering voters. More than 90% of those applications, or about 336,000, were denied as duplicates, primarily because people who had requested mail-in ballots for the state’s June 2 primary did not realize that they had checked a box to be sent ballots for the general election, too. Voters have also been baffled by unclear or inaccurate information on the state’s ballot-tracking website, and by a wave of mail ballot applications from political parties and get-out-the-vote groups.

Overall, one out of every five requests for mail ballots is being rejected in Pennsylvania. An estimated 208,000 Pennsylvania voters sent in the spurned requests, some submitting them multiple times. Although the state’s email rejecting the requests describes them as duplicates, it doesn’t explain why, prompting some people to reapply. ProPublica and The Inquirer identified hundreds of voters who submitted three or more duplicate applications; one voter appears to have submitted 11 duplicates. The administrative nightmare highlights the difficulty of ramping up vote-by-mail on the fly without enough voter education.

And many counties in the past simply accepted naked ballots, so they don’t show up in rejected ballot tallies. “It’s hard to say how big a problem this is, because Pennsylvania’s public accounting for rejected ballots is pretty limited,” said Charles Stewart III, a political science professor at MIT who studies election administration and quantitative measures of election performance. Pennsylvania’s overall rejection rate of mail ballots was less than 1% in 2016, “which is actually pretty low” for a state in which voters must provide a reason for voting by mail, Stewart said in an email. “Therefore, it’s hard to believe that this is the type of issue that would loom large in the vote count,” Stewart said.

Thousands of voters who used mail-in ballots in the Pennsylvania primary election this year did not have their votes counted, and election officials are working to ensure the same thing doesn't happen in the presidential election. Nearly 40,000 mail-in ballots were ""canceled"" by county election offices in the June primary, according to figures provided by the Pennsylvania Department of State, which oversees elections. Of those, 20,000 were canceled and their votes were not counted because the ballots were returned late or had an issue with the signature on the outer envelope. Another 20,000 mail-in ballots were canceled for other reasons, like the U.S. Postal Service marked them undeliverable or a voter cast a ballot in-person at a polling place.
		

How many mail-in ballots were rejected in Pennsylvania during the most recent U.S. election cycle? <|end|>		
Pa. has rejected 372,000 ballot applications — most of them duplicates — bewildering voters and straining officials Most rejected applications were deemed duplicates because voters had checked a request box during the primary. The administrative nightmare highlights the difficulty of ramping up mail-in voting on the fly. This article is co-published with ProPublica, a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power.
		

How many mail-in ballots were rejected in Pennsylvania during the most recent U.S. election cycle? <|end|>		
Months of baseless attacks by President Donald Trump that mail voting is susceptible to widespread fraud have soured many Republican voters on using the method and created a large partisan divide. Of Pennsylvania’s approved ballot applications as of Wednesday, more than 948,000 have come from Democrats, 343,000 from Republicans, and 241,000 from independent and third-party voters. Pennsylvania last year began allowing voters to apply online for mail-in ballots, but the state system doesn’t notify voters that they are submitting a duplicate. The online form links to a tool where voters can check their registration status, but it doesn’t link to the tool where they can check their vote-by-mail status.
		

How many mail-in ballots were rejected in Pennsylvania during the most recent U.S. election cycle? <|end|>		
The Pennsylvania Department of State advised counties to accept naked ballots as valid and count them in this year’s June primary. Most counties did so without tracking them. So there’s no statewide estimate for how many naked ballots there were. And before this year, Pennsylvania had a more restrictive absentee voting system: Only about 5% of votes were even cast by mail in previous elections. It’s hard to extrapolate from those elections to this year, when mail ballots may make up about half of the total votes cast.

84,It's unclear how Joe Biden acquired his recent wealth since leaving office in 2017,"What are the documented sources of Joe Biden's income and wealth since he left office in 2017?		
Joe Biden’s income spiked to $11 million after leaving office, tax returns show Joe Biden’s income jumped from less than $400,000 a year while he was vice president to more than $11 million in the year after he left office, a spike in wealth due to sales of his 2017 book and speaking fees that routinely ran more than $100,000 per event. Biden’s campaign released a financial disclosure form and three years of income tax returns starting with 2016, his last year in office, and running through 2018. He had previously released his returns from earlier years.
		

What are the documented sources of Joe Biden's income and wealth since he left office in 2017?		
Biden was a six-term senator before joining Barack Obama’s presidential ticket, and his financial disclosures often showed that he was among the Senate’s least wealthy members. He has described himself as “Middle Class Joe” on the campaign trail. But in the two years after he left the White House, Biden made $15.6 million, largely through speaking fees and book profits. He and Jill made $11 million in 2017 and $4.6 million in 2018, and paid $3.7 million in taxes in 2017 and $1.5 million in 2018, financial documents released by Biden’s campaign last year show.

Biden easily raked in the most money in the past two years among 2020 Democratic presidential candidates who have released tax returns so far. After the former vice president left the White House in January 2017, the Bidens pulled in millions from Joe Biden's speaking engagements and books written by both Joe and Jill Biden. The money Biden accumulated after his decadeslong career as an elected official clash with the image he has tried to craft as a humble champion of the working and middle class. The former senator from Delaware has referred to himself as ""Middle-Class Joe"" and touted his efforts to lift up union workers and low-income families.

Democratic presidential candidate and former vice president Joe Biden speaks at a campaign event in Sumter, S.C, on Saturday, July 6, 2019. WASHINGTON (AP) — Joe Biden and his wife, Jill, took in more than $15 million since leaving the Obama White House, according to newly released documents, catapulting the Democratic presidential candidate into millionaire status and denting the working-class aura he’s developed over decades. Long fond of describing himself as “Middle Class Joe” while he took in little more than his government salary, the former vice president stressed his working-class roots from the very beginning of his bid for his party’s 2020 presidential nomination . But federal tax returns and a financial disclosure released Tuesday show that since Biden left public office, his income has surged thanks to a lucrative book deal and constant publicity tours that brought in more than $4 million.
		

What are the documented sources of Joe Biden's income and wealth since he left office in 2017?		
Joe and Jill Biden reported earning more than $15 million in income since leaving the White House in 2017 The campaign says much of the money comes from book payments. Former Vice President Joe Biden and his wife, Dr. Jill Biden reported more than $15 million in income since leaving the White House in early 2017, newly released tax returns show. Tax returns, released by the Biden Campaign, show the Biden’s had an adjusted gross income of $4,580,437 in 2018, and $11,018,346 in 2017.
		

What are the documented sources of Joe Biden's income and wealth since he left office in 2017?		
The 2016 disclosure revealed financial assets worth more than $273,000 — including a $150,000 rental property — and more than $750,000 in debt. Those liabilities included a recent mortgage worth more than $500,000 on the rental property and a recent $250,000 home equity loan. But much of that debt has been paid off, according to the latest disclosure, which showed only two old loans, each worth no more than $15,000 and dating to the 1980s. Biden’s three newly available tax returns, for 2016, 2017 and 2018, show that his family income jumped from $400,000 in 2016 to $11 million in 2017 as a result of his book deal.
		

What are the documented sources of Joe Biden's income and wealth since he left office in 2017?		
As vice president, Biden earned up to $230,700 a year, and as a senator his annual salary varied from $44,600 when he began serving in the Senate in 1973 to $169,300 by the time he left the chamber in January 2009. The Bidens’ returns going back to 2008 also include income from Social Security benefits. But once Biden departed the vice presidency in January 2017, he could take advantage of more lucrative private-sector opportunities. Both Bidens wrote books afterward, and Joe Biden’s presidential financial disclosure form lists more than four dozen events characterized either as speaking engagements or book tour events, for each of which he typically earned five- and six-figure payments.
		

What are the documented sources of Joe Biden's income and wealth since he left office in 2017?		
Joe Biden’s first year in the private sector proved to be his most lucrative in at least two decades. He and his wife, Jill, earned about $11.1 million in 2017, nearly double their total earnings from 1998 to 2016, which added up to $5.8 million, according to a Forbes analysis of tax returns. The couple brought in another $4.6 million last year. The bulk of the Bidens’ big payday came from a book deal and speaking engagements. Joe Biden routed his book and speaking payments through a company named CelticCapri Corp., which took in $9.5 million in 2017 and $2.7 million in 2018.

85,India's Congress party candidate Maskoor Usmani installed Jinnah's portrait at AMU.,"In what capacity did Maskoor Usmani serve during the relevant period, and what official actions or decisions did he take regarding the installation of portraits at AMU?		
After the Congress party fielded former Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) student leader Maskoor Usmani as a candidate from the Jale constituency in the upcoming Bihar assembly elections, Hindi news channel AajTak, accused Usmani of being a “Jinnah supporter” and claimed that in 2018, he had installed a portrait of Pakistan’s founder Muhammad Ali Jinnah at the AMU. However, several accounts by journalists, historians and the AMU administration have revealed that the portrait has been on the wall in the university since the pre-independence era. In a bulletin helmed by anchor Rohit Sardana, the channel claimed that “Maskoor Usmani hung a portrait of Mohammad Ali Jinnah at AMU when he was the Chief of the varsity’s student union”. Twenty-one seconds into the video, Sardana claims that “Maskoor Usmani stirred controversy in 2018 by hanging a portrait of Jinnah at AMU”.

Aaj Tak Falsely Claims Congress Candidate Maskoor Usmani Hung Jinnah’s Portrait at AMU The Congress party has fielded former Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) student leader Maskoor Usmani as a candidate for the upcoming Bihar assembly elections. He will be contesting from Jale constituency in Darbhanga district of Bihar. Usmani’s candidature has given the BJP an opportunity to criticise the Congress. The former has accused Usmani of being a ‘Jinnah supporter’.
		

In what capacity did Maskoor Usmani serve during the relevant period, and what official actions or decisions did he take regarding the installation of portraits at AMU?		
Similar claims appear in the bulletin at 1.29 minutes and then again at 6.25 minutes. While it is true that a portrait of Jinnah has been hanging in the AMU since 1938, AajTak’s claim that Usmani installed the portrait is completely false. The issue first came to light in 2018 when BJP MP from Aligarh Satish Gautam wrote a letter to AMU Vice Chancellor Tariq Mansoor, asking him about the compulsion behind installing a photo of Jinnah. Explaining why Jinnah’s portrait is installed in the university, AMU spokesperson Shafey Kidwai told NDTV that Jinnah was a founder of the university and was granted life membership of the student union.

Anchor Rohit Sardana in his daily show ‘Dangal’ invited several panellists to discuss Usmani’s candidature. The channel claimed multiple times (1:24 minutes and 6:20 minutes) that in 2018 Usmani installed a portrait of Pakistan’s founder Muhammad Ali Jinnah at AMU.

The August 7 post was later marked by Facebook as containing “False Information” based on two independent fact checks by the Associated Press and PolitiFact. This claim and others like it is both highly unlikely and illegal, according to experts. “The way it works is, people can no more vote multiple mail ballots than they could go into various different polling places on Election Day and try to vote,” said David Becker, founder of the Center for Election Innovation and Research. When election officials mail out a ballot to a voter, they verify that the voter’s signature on the ballot application form matches the voter’s signature on file.

Receiving multiple ballot applications won’t let you vote more than once — here’s why As more people are expected to vote by mail in the 2020 Election in November due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, much has been said about the security and accuracy of casting a ballot through the mail. One widely-viewed photo shared to Facebook claimed an Illinois couple who received five vote-by-mail applications at their address would be able to send them back and receive five ballots — enabling two people to cast five votes “with no one the wiser.” The image shows five envelopes marked as “Official Election Mail” from the Fayette County Clerk & Recorder’s office sent to five individuals at a single address.

Outside organizations, including political parties, may also mail Illinois voters ballot request forms, which could result in voters receiving more than one ballot application. In North Carolina, voters received absentee ballot request forms bearing President Donald Trump’s face. “If someone sent in 10 requests for a mail ballot, they would receive one. In some states, that might even be against the law,” Becker said, adding that each voter has a unique voter ID number that is tied to a single ballot. “If they tried to return multiple mail ballots, if for some reason they took someone’s mail ballot that they shouldn’t have, there are codings on the outside of those ballots,” Becker said.

Under a long-standing state law, election counts are not final and official until at least 14 days after Election Day to allow for all late-arriving Vote By Mail Ballots and all eligible provisional ballots to be included in the counts. Falsifying Eligibility for Vote By Mail Ballots, Intimidation/Interference It is a felony in Illinois to vote more than once in the same election or to attempt to vote more than once in the same election. Knowingly submitting false statements concerning identity or eligibility to Vote By Mail may be prosecuted under Illinois law (10 ILCS 5/29-10), a Class 3 felony.

In Washington, one of a handful of states that has held elections by mail even before the COVID-19 outbreak, county officials check the signature on every single ballot envelope and compare it to the voter registration signature on file. If those two things don’t match, they contact the voter and give them a second chance — which is also a fraud check. Washington Secretary of State Kim Wyman, a Republican who oversees her state’s mail-in voting process, said the state has not seen “any kind of rampant fraud in my 27 years of doing elections.” During the 2018 election, the state found that out of 3.2 million ballots cast, there were 142 cases of voter fraud — where people had either voted more than once or cast a ballot for a deceased family member.

Voting more than once. Any person who, having voted once, knowingly during any election where the ballot or machine lists any of the same candidates and issues listed on the ballot or machine previously used for voting by that person, (a) files an application to vote in the same or another polling place, or (b) accepts a ballot or enters a voting machine (except to legally give assistance pursuant to the provisions of this code), shall be guilty of a Class 3 felony; however, if a person has delivered a ballot or ballots to an election authority as a vote by mail voter and due to a change of circumstances is able to and does vote in the precinct of his residence on election day, shall not be deemed to be in violation of this code. Prohibits knowingly receiving a ballot in the wrong jurisdiction. §3-14-2-16. A person who knowingly does any of the following commits a Class D felony: (1) Applies for or receives a ballot in a precinct other than that precinct in which the person is entitled to vote. §3-14-2-4. A person who recklessly registers or offers to register to vote more than once commits a Class A misdemeanor.

Also, the State Board conducts audits after each election that check voter history against ballots cast and would detect if someone tries to vote more than once in an election. Because absentee ballots and early voting ballots are retrievable, if someone tries to get around the system, their ballot can be retrieved and not counted, so it will not affect the outcome of an election. The State Board has a dedicated investigations team that investigates allegations of double voting, which are referred to prosecutors when warranted. If you request an absentee by-mail ballot but decide later that you would like to vote in person instead, you may.

89,"Most deaths in the 1918 influenza pandemic originated from bacterial pneumonia caused by face masks and that Dr Anthony Fauci, the US government’s top expert in the fight against Covid-19, knew about it.","Did bacterial pneumonia, exacerbated by the use of face masks, play a primary role in the deaths during the 1918 influenza pandemic, and did Dr. Anthony Fauci have knowledge of this historical fact during his career?		
Bacterial Pneumonia Caused Most Deaths in 1918 Influenza Pandemic The majority of deaths during the influenza pandemic of 1918-1919 were not caused by the influenza virus acting alone, report researchers from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health. Instead, most victims succumbed to bacterial pneumonia following influenza virus infection. The pneumonia was caused when bacteria that normally inhabit the nose and throat invaded the lungs along a pathway created when the virus destroyed the cells that line the bronchial tubes and lungs. A future influenza pandemic may unfold in a similar manner, say the NIAID authors, whose paper in the Oct. 1 issue of The Journal of Infectious Diseases is now available online.
		

Did bacterial pneumonia, exacerbated by the use of face masks, play a primary role in the deaths during the 1918 influenza pandemic, and did Dr. Anthony Fauci have knowledge of this historical fact during his career?		
Therefore, the authors conclude, comprehensive pandemic preparations should include not only efforts to produce new or improved influenza vaccines and antiviral drugs but also provisions to stockpile antibiotics and bacterial vaccines as well. The work presents complementary lines of evidence from the fields of pathology and history of medicine to support this conclusion. ""The weight of evidence we examined from both historical and modern analyses of the 1918 influenza pandemic favors a scenario in which viral damage followed by bacterial pneumonia led to the vast majority of deaths,"" says co-author NIAID Director Anthony S. Fauci, M.D. "" In essence, the virus landed the first blow while bacteria delivered the knockout punch.""
		

Did bacterial pneumonia, exacerbated by the use of face masks, play a primary role in the deaths during the 1918 influenza pandemic, and did Dr. Anthony Fauci have knowledge of this historical fact during his career?		
Published pathologic and/or bacteriologic findings from the 1918–1919 influenza pandemic Although the cause of influenza was disputed in 1918, there was almost universal agreement among experts [e.g., 20, 27–33] that deaths were virtually never caused by the unidentified etiologic agent itself, but resulted directly from severe secondary pneumonia caused by well-known bacterial “pneumopathogens” that colonized the upper respiratory tract (predominantly pneumococci, streptococci, and staphylococci). Without this secondary bacterial pneumonia, experts generally believed that most patients would have recovered [20]. In type, pattern, and case-fatality rate, influenza-associated bacterial pneumonia was typical of pneumonia that was endemic during periods when influenza was not prevalent [25, 28, 33, 34].
		

Did bacterial pneumonia, exacerbated by the use of face masks, play a primary role in the deaths during the 1918 influenza pandemic, and did Dr. Anthony Fauci have knowledge of this historical fact during his career?		
Predominant Role of Bacterial Pneumonia as a Cause of Death in Pandemic Influenza: Implications for Pandemic Influenza Preparedness Despite the availability of published data on 4 pandemics that have occurred over the past 120 years, there is little modern information on the causes of death associated with influenza pandemics. We examined relevant information from the most recent influenza pandemic that occurred during the era prior to the use of antibiotics, the 1918–1919 “Spanish flu” pandemic. We examined lung tissue sections obtained during 58 autopsies and reviewed pathologic and bacteriologic data from 109 published autopsy series that described 8398 individual autopsy investigations.
		

Did bacterial pneumonia, exacerbated by the use of face masks, play a primary role in the deaths during the 1918 influenza pandemic, and did Dr. Anthony Fauci have knowledge of this historical fact during his career?		
The postmortem samples we examined from people who died of influenza during 1918–1919 uniformly exhibited severe changes indicative of bacterial pneumonia. Bacteriologic and histopathologic results from published autopsy series clearly and consistently implicated secondary bacterial pneumonia caused by common upper respiratory–tract bacteria in most influenza fatalities. The majority of deaths in the 1918–1919 influenza pandemic likely resulted directly from secondary bacterial pneumonia caused by common upper respiratory–tract bacteria. Less substantial data from the subsequent 1957 and 1968 pandemics are consistent with these findings.
		

Did bacterial pneumonia, exacerbated by the use of face masks, play a primary role in the deaths during the 1918 influenza pandemic, and did Dr. Anthony Fauci have knowledge of this historical fact during his career?		
With the recent reconstruction of the 1918 pandemic influenza virus, investigators have begun to examine why it was so highly fatal [6, 7]. Based on contemporary and modern evidence, we conclude here that influenza A virus infection in conjunction with bacterial infection led to most of the deaths during the 1918–1919 pandemic. Examination of tissue specimens from 1918–1919 influenza fatalities We reviewed hematoxylin and eosin–stained slides recut from blocks of lung tissue obtained during autopsy from 58 influenza fatalities in 1918–1919.
		

Did bacterial pneumonia, exacerbated by the use of face masks, play a primary role in the deaths during the 1918 influenza pandemic, and did Dr. Anthony Fauci have knowledge of this historical fact during his career?		
Certain observers believed that cotransmission of the influenza agent and of pneumopathogenic bacteria was responsible for many severe and fatal cases, especially during the October–November 1918 peak of mortality and case-fatality rates [81]. We speculate that any influenza virus with an enhanced capacity to spread to and damage bronchial and/or bronchiolar epithelial cells, even in the presence of an intact rapid reparative response, could precipitate the appearance of severe and potentially fatal bacterial pneumonia due to prevalent upper respiratory–tract bacteria. In the modern era, the widespread use of antibiotics and the establishment of life-prolonging intensive care unit treatment make it more difficult than it was in 1918 to document the importance of bacterial lung infection for influenza-related mortality. Influenza-associated pneumonia patterns may now be influenced by the administration of pneumococcus, Hemophilus influenzae b, and meningococcus vaccine, and cases have tended to occur in elderly individuals, who rarely undergo autopsy.
		

Did bacterial pneumonia, exacerbated by the use of face masks, play a primary role in the deaths during the 1918 influenza pandemic, and did Dr. Anthony Fauci have knowledge of this historical fact during his career?		
In the most recent influenza pandemic that did not involve the use of antibiotics to suppress bacteria (the 1918–1919 pandemic), histological and bacteriologic evidence suggests that the vast majority of influenza deaths resulted from secondary bacterial pneumonia. Compelling evidence for this conclusion includes the examination of 58 recut and restained autopsy specimens that showed changes fully consistent with classical descriptions of extensive bacterial pneumonia [25], culture results from numerous international autopsy series, and consistent epidemiologic and clinical findings (table 3). |Most autopsies revealed severe bacterial pneumonia caused by common upper respiratory organisms |In type, pattern, and case-fatality rate, influenza-associated bacterial pneumonia, including chronic lobar pneumonia, was typical of pneumonia during periods when influenza was not prevalent; bronchopneumonia, associated with diffuse “panbronchitis,” predominated
		

Did bacterial pneumonia, exacerbated by the use of face masks, play a primary role in the deaths during the 1918 influenza pandemic, and did Dr. Anthony Fauci have knowledge of this historical fact during his career?		
[20, 30, 32]. The pneumonia deaths during the influenza pandemic in 1918 proved so highly similar, pathologically, to the then-recent pneumonia deaths from the measles epidemics that noted experts considered them to be the result of one newly emerging disease: epidemic bacterial pneumonia precipitated by prevalent respiratory tract agents [20, 33, 63]. The question of whether the pathogenesis of severe influenza-associated pneumonia was primarily viral (i.e., assumed to be an unknown etiologic agent in 1918) or a combination of viral and bacterial agents was carefully considered by pathologists in 1918–1919, without definitive resolution [26, 33]. The issue was addressed anew in the early 1930s when Shope published a series of experimental studies that involved the just-discovered swine influenza A virus: severe disease in an animal model resulted only when the virus and Hemophilus influenzae suis were administered together [67]. In 1935, Brightman studied combined human influenza and streptococcal infection in a ferret intranasal inoculation model.
		

Did bacterial pneumonia, exacerbated by the use of face masks, play a primary role in the deaths during the 1918 influenza pandemic, and did Dr. Anthony Fauci have knowledge of this historical fact during his career?		
The 1968 influenza pandemic was mild, and autopsy studies were uncommon [21]. Fatal cases of influenza-associated viral pneumonia that are considered to be “primary” (i.e., with little or no bacterial growth) continue to be identified [82, 83]; however, their incidence appears to be low, even in pandemic peaks. The issue of the pathogenesis of fatal influenza-associated pneumonia remains important; the fact that even severe, virus-induced tissue damage is normally followed by rapid and extensive repair [20, 26] suggests that early and aggressive treatment, including antibiotics and intensive care, could save most patients [84, 85] and also underscores the importance of prevention and prophylaxis. The 1918 pandemic and subsequent pandemics differed with respect to the spectrum and extent of secondary bacterial pneumonia (e.g., the switch in prevalence during the antibiotic era to predominantly staphylococcal secondary pneumonia, as opposed to streptococcal, pneumococcal, and mixed secondary pneumonia; and the greatly decreased involvement of Bacillus [Hemophilus] influenzae), suggesting that additional factors affect the level of influenza morbidity and mortality. These might include the use of antibiotics and antiviral agents, the rate of influenza vaccination and bacterial vaccination, and demographic and social factors.

To talk about both, we answer the question did Kamala Harris fail the bar exam, and what happens if I do too? Yes, it is true Kamala Harris failed the bar exam the first time she took it.

We are not writing this post to criticize Kamala Harris. In fact, we want to do the exact opposite! She’s gone on to achieve great things after passing on her second attempt. She served as California Attorney General, and also represented California in the U.S. Senate. She may very well become the Vice President of the United States. Your major takeaway should be that failing the bar exam is not a career-killer. You can still have a great and successful career if you fail the bar exam Plenty of famous and incredibly successful people, including Michelle Obama President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, failed the bar exam the first time they took it. In fact, in some jurisdictions, more people fail than pass the bar exam. For example, California’s pass rate for all takers in 2019 was 43%.

Did Kamala Harris ever disclose her bar exam attempts, and is there any verified record of her failing it on her first attempt?		
She kept this news hidden for the next thirty years. She never took the exam again, despite many opportunities. Her closest friends and associates were flabbergasted when she made the revelation in a single throwaway line in Living History. Those who knew her best speculated that she must have felt deep shame at her failure, and that her self-confidence — always so visible a part of her exterior — wasshattered by the experience (though many first-rate lawyers, even Yale Law graduates, had flunked the bar on their first try).

Failing the Bar Exam is Not as Catastrophic as it Seems There are numerous reasons why individuals fail the bar exam, and they have little to do with their competency or potential as a future attorney. With so much hype and hard work leading up to the exam, it can be a shattering experience to fail on the first attempt. Remember, you are in good company. Some notable people who failed the bar exam on their first attempt include distinguished names like John F. Kennedy, Jr., and Hillary Clinton.

Failing the bar exam doesn’t end your story; it can be a wonderful beginning. Don’t believe me? Take a look below at this list of famous people who failed the bar exam, some of them multiple times. Franklin D. Roosevelt failed the New York bar exam the first time he took it, but that didn’t stop him from trying again. He passed in 1907, but dropped out of Columbia Law School years later and eventually became one of the most prominent presidents in American history, leading our country through the trying times of World War II.

The New Zealand Abortion Legislation Act 2020 is an Act of Parliament in New Zealand that amends the law to decriminalise abortion.

Women seeking an abortion after 20 weeks have to be looked at by a qualified health professional.[5] - ↑ 1.0 1.1 ""Abortion Legislation Bill 2019 164-1"". New Zealand Parliament.

The Abortion Legislation Act 2020 is an Act of Parliament in New Zealand allowing unrestricted access to abortion within the first 20 weeks of pregnancy, and repealing sections of the Crimes Act 1961 related to unlawful abortion. After the 20-week period, women seeking an abortion must consult a qualified health practitioner who will assess their physical health, mental health, and well-being. The Act also provides provisions for conscientious objection rights for medical practitioners and exempts abortion services from certain Crimes Act provisions, while extending the definition of health services to include abortion services under the Health and Disability Commissioner Act 1994.[5] Elective abortion care had been available for several decades in New Zealand before this Act was passed, but women had to maintain a fiction that they were suffering from mental illness in order to get an abortion.[6]

In practice, the law was interpreted liberally,[7] and the system actually operates as elective abortion,[8][9] with one in four women in New Zealand having had an abortion in her lifetime.[10] Almost all women had their abortion approved under the mental health ground. Politician David Seymour called the law a ""charade"" and commented ""nobody believes that 97 per cent of women who have abortions are mentally ill""; while journalist Mark Sainsbury commented ""the patients, the doctors, the politicians, just to play their part and, nod nod wink wink, it gets done"".[11] On 5 August 2019, the Minister of Justice Andrew Little announced that the Labour-led coalition government would be introducing new legislation to decriminalise abortion and to allow women unrestricted access to abortion within the 20 week gestation period. The New Zealand Law Commission had proposed three options for abortion reform: having no statutory test to make sure the abortion was appropriate at any point; taking abortion off the Crimes Act but having a statutory test; or only having a test for later-term abortions, after 22 weeks.

However, Ministry of Justice records show that these related to physical assaults on pregnant women that caused (or were intended to cause) a miscarriage – not medical or surgical abortions. There has been one conviction for providing the means of procuring an unlawful abortion (for supplying pills illegally). Not officially. By law, there is no automatic ‘right’ to have an abortion. However, in practice, there is evidence to suggest that abortion is more accessible than the law would appear to allow, because certifying Consultants adopt a very wide interpretation of the ‘mental health’ ground for abortion. Most abortions are provided on this ground. New Zealand’s annual abortion rate is comparable to jurisdictions with ‘health’-oriented abortion laws, which may suggest that a high percentage of requests for abortion are granted.

Trump has vehemently denied all of the various women’s accusations multiple times. In some cases, he and his team members have specifically denied individual accusations, but they have also repeatedly issued blanket denials against all the allegations, calling the women liars. The topic resurfaced in fall 2018 while Trump defended his Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. In defending Kavanaugh against allegations of a sexual assault during high school, which Kavanaugh denied, Trump took the opportunity to push back against the various accusations against him that arose during his first presidential run. At a Sept. 27, 2018, press conference, Trump brushed off what he called ""false accusations"" he has faced, saying that he was ""accused by four or five women who got paid to make up stories about me.""

McDowell, through her attorney, reaffirmed her allegations to ABC News in November but declined to be interviewed. Karena Virginia, a New York-area yoga instructor, said Trump approached her in 1998 outside the U.S. Open tennis tournament in New York while she was awaiting a car service, made unseemly comments about her appearance, grabbed her arm and groped her breast. ""He then walked up to me and reached his right arm and grabbed my right arm,"" she said at a news conference in October 2016. “Then his hand touched the right inside of my breast.""

98,The iPhone 12 won’t come with earphones and a charging adapter.,"Does Apple provide the iPhone 12 with a charging adapter and earphones in the box as standard packaging?		
iPhone 12 Models Ship in Thinner Box Without EarPods or Charger As expected, the entire iPhone 12 lineup ships without EarPods or a power adapter in the box, with only a Lightning to USB-C charging cable included. Apple touted the environmental benefits of no longer bundling these accessories, noting that the move reduces carbon emissions and avoids the mining and use of rare-earth elements. With these accessories removed, iPhone 12 models ship in a thinner box, as seen below.
		

Does Apple provide the iPhone 12 with a charging adapter and earphones in the box as standard packaging?		
iPhone 12 will likely come without earbuds and power adapter You'll probably have to buy both separately, according to report citing a noted analyst. We already knew Apple's future iPhone 12 might ship without the white wired earbuds we're used to seeing in the box with all new iPhones. But now it looks like iPhone 12 will arrive without a power adapter as well.

Apple's new iPhone 12, iPhone 12 Pro models will come without charger and headphones As usual, Apple's unveiling of its next wave of iPhones got a lot of attention. But some carping arose about a few things not included in the iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 Pro smartphones box: earphones and a charging adapter. The iPhone 12 Pro (starting at $999) and iPhone 12 ($799), both available for preorder Friday (to ship out Oct. 23), will not come with wired EarPod headphones or the charging adapter (the little square), which links a device's Lighting input and a USB power adapter. The same goes for the iPhone 12 Mini and Pro Max models, which go up for preorder Nov. 6, and launch Nov. 13.

Apple Will Not Include Earphones In The Box, Starting With iPhone 12, As Revealed In iOS 14 Code There were rumours of Apple removing the earphones and charger from the box of the upcoming iPhone 12 series and now it seems like we may have a confirmation for one of them. Apple recently released the iOS 14.2 update that had some information regarding the accessories that might be removed from the box from this year. The information was discovered by MacRumors hidden in the iOS 14.2 code which had a minor tweak suggesting the removal of earphones from the box of the iPhone 12.

- Take our quick poll at the end of the post to let us know how you feel about it. When you buy a new phone, the least you expect to find in the box is a charging cable, a power adapter, and maybe a pair of earphones. Sadly, Apple might do away with at least two of those three main smartphone accessories when it launches the iPhone 12 series. According to famed Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo (via MacRumors), Apple will remove the power adapter and EarPods from the box of the iPhone 12 and force you to buy a new 20W charging adapter separately.

""As part of our efforts to reach our environmental goals, iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 mini do not include a power adapter or EarPods,"" reads Apple's website, with a similar message shown for the iPhone 12 Pro and iPhone 12 Pro Max. ""Please use your current Apple power adapter and headphones, or purchase these accessories separately."" Last month, the Apple Watch Series 6 and Apple Watch SE launched without chargers in the box, so it is no surprise that iPhones have followed suit. Starting today, the iPhone SE, iPhone 11, and iPhone XR also ship without EarPods or a charger in the box.

iPhone 12 confirmed to ship without charger — but at least the box will be nice Leaker claims new iPhone 12 box will be 'exquisite' It's becoming increasingly clear that all of the accessories that used to come with iPhones of the past won't come with the iPhone 12. First we heard Apple's wired EarPods were out, and then we received reports from multiple analysts saying the charging brick would suffer the same fate.
		

Does Apple provide the iPhone 12 with a charging adapter and earphones in the box as standard packaging?		
The complementary accessories have been included in every iPhone retail box to date, and most smartphone makers bundle the same free products with their devices. There are several explanations for the surprising move, and they’re all valid reasons for ditching the charger and earphones. But the real reason the iPhone 12 might only ship with a charging cable in the box might be something entirely different. And it’s all about the courage that fuels all of Apple’s controversial decisions.
		

Does Apple provide the iPhone 12 with a charging adapter and earphones in the box as standard packaging?		
iPhone 11, XR, and SE No Longer Come With EarPods and Power Adapter But USB-C to Lightning Cable Included Apple's new iPhone 12 models don't come with EarPods or a power adapter in the box in order to save on packaging materials to reduce environmental impact, and following today's event, Apple has removed the power adapter and EarPods from the box for all other iPhone models as well. As was rumored this morning, the iPhone 11, XR, and SE will no longer be shipped with power adapters or EarPods, much like the iPhone 12 models. This will allow Apple to use new, slimmer packaging.
		

Does Apple provide the iPhone 12 with a charging adapter and earphones in the box as standard packaging?		
Apple may not include a power adapter and earphones in the box with the new iPhone 12, set to be released later this year, according to a respected leaker. The tech giant, which usually includes an adapter and a pair of its wired EarPods in the box of every iPhone, will sell them separately due to increased production costs related to components that support 5G. This change will reportedly apply to the firm’s four new iPhone 12 models, set to be released in October this year at the very earliest, as well as the new budget iPhone SE, which was released earlier this year. iPhone 12 may not even support wired headphones, which would push customers towards Apple's £160 wireless Bluetooth AirPods.

99,New Zealand's Abortion Legislation Act (2020) does not make it a legal requirement that babies born alive after an abortion are given medical support.,"Does the New Zealand Abortion Legislation Act (2020) explicitly state the legal requirements regarding medical support for babies born alive after an abortion?		
New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has joined 80 other politicians in voting against an attempt to require health professionals to give medical help to babies born alive after ‘failed’ abortions. The Care of child born after abortion amendment was brought forward by the MP for Tamaki, Simon O’Connor at the committee stage of the Abortion Legislation Bill. The amendment would have required, that if a baby was born alive following a failed abortion, a qualified health practitioner or any other health practitioner present at the time the child is born, would have a duty to provide the child with appropriate medical care and treatment. It would have also required the medical care and treatment of a child born as a result of a failed abortion to be no different than the duty to provide medical care and treatment to a child born other than as a result of an abortion.
		

Does the New Zealand Abortion Legislation Act (2020) explicitly state the legal requirements regarding medical support for babies born alive after an abortion?		
Data from the few other countries where there are similar extreme abortion laws to the one proposed in New Zealand shows that it is likely that many more babies will be born alive following abortions, as it will in practice allow abortion for any reason between 20-weeks and birth – when unborn children are much more likely to survive a ‘failed’ abortion. A similar law in Victoria, Australia allows for abortion right through to birth on physical, psychological and social grounds when approved by two doctors; this can be the abortion operating surgeon and anaesthetist. This has, in practice, allowed for abortion on demand, for any reason, right through to birth in Victoria. Ahead of the legislation being introduced in Victoria in 2008, abortion activists claimed that, although abortion would, in practice, be allowed for any reason, doctors would ensure that the vast majority of abortions would only occur in rare circumstances, such as when a baby has a condition where they would either die in the womb or shortly after birth (a fatal foetal abnormality or life-limiting disability) – similar claims are currently now being made about the proposed NZ abortion law by abortion campaigners and MPs in New Zealand.

The law in Victoria allows for abortion right through to birth on physical, psychological and social grounds when approved by two doctors; this can be the abortion operating surgeon and anaesthetist. The provision in Victoria is very similar to the provision outlined in the New Zealand Bill, except the New Zealand provision has even fewer safeguards. The proposed legislation in New Zealand law would allow abortions between 20-weeks gestation and birth, with the go-ahead from just two health practitioners (this could include nurses and midwives) rather than the higher threshold of two doctors that are required in Victoria. The Abortion Legislation Committee have now widened the already loose criteria to include “overall well-being” – making it even easier for abortions to happen between 20-weeks and birth in New Zealand.

Ed Markey last year, to tackle climate change.)","Has President Joe Biden publicly endorsed or expressed support for the Green New Deal resolution as introduced by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Sen. Ed Markey?		
During Tuesday night’s debate, Biden was asked by moderator Chris Wallace if he supported the Green New Deal, a wide-ranging joint, nonbinding resolution to combat climate change introduced by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Sen. Ed Markey. “No, I don’t support the Green New Deal,” Biden said. “Oh you don’t? Oh, well, that’s a big statement,” Trump interrupted. “I support the Biden plan that I put forward,” Biden said, “which is different than what (Trump) calls the ‘radical’ Green New Deal.”
		

Has President Joe Biden publicly endorsed or expressed support for the Green New Deal resolution as introduced by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Sen. Ed Markey?		
Second, the 2020 Biden campaign website still includes a line that reads, “Biden believes the Green New Deal is a crucial framework for meeting the climate challenges we face. It powerfully captures two basic truths, which are at the core of his plan: (1) the United States urgently needs to embrace greater ambition on an epic scale to meet the scope of this challenge, and (2) our environment and our economy are completely and totally connected.” Lastly, there is the fact that Biden’s own running mate is an early supporter of the Green New Deal. In February 2019, two Green New Deal resolutions were introduced in Congress. Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York introduced a resolution in the House.
		

Has President Joe Biden publicly endorsed or expressed support for the Green New Deal resolution as introduced by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Sen. Ed Markey?		
“No,” Biden answered definitively. “I don’t support the Green New Deal. I support the Biden plan that I put forward. … The Biden plan, which is different than what [President Trump] calls the radical Green New Deal.” Well, this is awkward, and for a couple of reasons. First, it seems strange to disavow the Green New Deal after alleging specifically that it will “pay for itself as we move forward.”
		

Has President Joe Biden publicly endorsed or expressed support for the Green New Deal resolution as introduced by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Sen. Ed Markey?		
He said backing Biden was better than supporting the “climate denier in the Oval Office.” “The Green New Deal has shifted the whole discussion. The goals have lifted the gaze of Americans and political leaders,” he said. “I’m going to continue to advocate for the Green New Deal, which saves all of creation while investing in massive job creation.” As Senate Republican leaders prepare to open a confirmation hearing for for President Donald Trump’s Supreme Court nominee next week, the future of abortion rights has been called into question.
		

Has President Joe Biden publicly endorsed or expressed support for the Green New Deal resolution as introduced by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Sen. Ed Markey?		
On Wednesday, Biden reiterated this stance, telling reporters “the Green New Deal that the President keeps trying to talk about, it’s not a bad deal, but it’s not the plan I have. That’s the Biden green deal, that’s what it’s about.” On Twitter Tuesday night, Ocasio-Cortez said Biden not supporting the GND “isn’t news.” “Our differences are exactly why I joined Biden’s Climate Unity Task Force - so we could set aside our differences & figure out an aggressive climate plan to address the planetary crisis at our feet.”

He’s not alone in thinking Sunrise’s approach has altered national politics. In February 2019, Ocasio-Cortez and Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) formally introduced the Green New Deal — which calls for a ""fair and just transition"" — as a nonbinding resolution. Later, during Democratic presidential debates, the Green New Deal would also become a litmus test for presidential candidates, many of whom eventually endorsed the proposal. Last week, a nine-person task force released a widely circulated climate policy road map for former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee.

Biden, during Tuesday night’s debate, said he didn’t support the Green New Deal, though his environmental plan on his website calls it a “crucial framework” for fighting climate change. Trump said the deal was “conceived of by not smart people,” in reference to New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Massachusetts Sen. Ed Markey, who introduced the proposal last year. He claimed it would cost $100 trillion, citing one right-leaning think tank’s estimate. “That’s more money than this country could make in 100 years if things went well,” Trump said. “I mean they literally wanna take buildings down and rebuild them with tiny little windows, little windows

“We both agree that we have a New Green Deal to deal with the existential threat [of climate change] that faces humanity,” Biden said. “We disagree on the detail of how we do it, but we don’t disagree on the principle.” Biden’s website called the Green New Deal “a crucial framework.” Sanders, meanwhile, called his climate plan the “Green New Deal.” That the two would endorse such an agenda is a huge shift from just a few months ago, when some candidates criticized its cost and scope.
		

Has President Joe Biden publicly endorsed or expressed support for the Green New Deal resolution as introduced by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Sen. Ed Markey?		
""We were very clear about our message, very clear about our priorities and very clear about the fact that even if you've never voted before we are talking to you."" In February 2019, Ocasio-Cortez and Massachusetts Senator Ed Markey introduced a resolution outlining the scope of a ""Green New Deal."" The resolution proposed the switch to renewable energy sources for the entire country, with the goal of achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. Additionally, the plan called for major investments in clean energy technology research and development, with Ocasio-Cortez also aiming to include a federal jobs guarantee, basic income and universal health care under the umbrella of the Green New Deal.
		

Has President Joe Biden publicly endorsed or expressed support for the Green New Deal resolution as introduced by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Sen. Ed Markey?		
Ocasio-Cortez has also been a leading congressional supporter of the Green New Deal, an ambitious and expensive plan to fundamentally remake the American economy around a blueprint to move the country to clean, renewable energy over the next decade. She teamed with Sen. Ed Markey of Massachusetts, who has already endorsed Warren, to introduce a Green New Deal resolution earlier this year. Sanders, Warren and other leading Democrats have endorsed the plan. Next week, Ocasio-Cortez will – alongside Markey and other activists, including the Sunrise Movement – headline an event at Howard University in Washington to kick off what Sunrise is calling “a nationwide campaign to make the 2020 election a referendum on the Green New Deal.”

As deadlines around the country have come and gone, West, a rapper who has avidly supported President Donald Trump in the past and announced a run for the presidency earlier this summer, is officially on the ballot in 11 states. His campaign has been unusual. Though he's running as a member of the ""Birthday Party,"" it has been Republicans who have consistently worked on the often chaotic, buzzer-beater efforts to get West on ballots around the country.

The latter was decided by fewer than 23,000 votes in 2016, part of Trump’s inside straight in the Midwest that allowed him to triumph in the Electoral College despite losing the national popular vote. Turnout among Black voters in Wisconsin was lower with Hillary Clinton on the ballot in 2016 than it had been with Barack Obama. West knows this could throw a wrench in the election. Or, as he put it when asked by Forbes about damaging Biden’s electoral chances: “I’m not denying it.” (West also met with Trump son-in-law/adviser Jared Kushner recently, although Kushner says it was a general policy discussion.)

Trump has already remade the federal bench for a generation, with the Republican Senate confirming more than 200 of his judicial nominees. And any vacancy in the highest court would give November’s winner — be it Trump or Biden — the ability to shape its future for decades to come. Trump has stressed that power on the campaign trail, claiming the person who wins could have “anywhere from two to four, to maybe even five” Supreme Court justices to pick, though that would require an extraordinary level of turnover. Trump released two lists with a total of 21 names of potential Supreme Court nominees during his previous presidential campaign and added another five names in 2017 after becoming president.

The list includes a trio of conservative Republican senators: Ted Cruz of Texas, Tom Cotton of Arkansas and Josh Hawley of Missouri — all buzzed-about potential 2024 Republican presidential candidates — as well as Christopher Landau, the current ambassador to Mexico, and Noel Francisco, who argued 17 cases as the Trump administration’s top Supreme Court lawyer.

Beyond these monumental victories on the Supreme Court — and possibly his biggest achievement of his first term — President Trump has nominated more than 200 federal judges to the bench, which is more than a quarter of the judges currently sitting. The number of federal judges appointed to the judiciary by President Trump and confirmed by the Senate has far outpaced President Barack Obama's record.

Donald Trump has successfully appointed more federal appeals court judges so far in his presidency than Barack Obama and George W.

And with his nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, Trump soon could install his second justice on the nation’s highest court, too. But while Trump has already left a considerable imprint on the nation’s higher federal courts, he trails Obama, Bush and other recent presidents in the number of lower-court judges he has appointed to date. As of July 12, Trump has successfully appointed 43 judges, including one Supreme Court justice (Neil Gorsuch), 22 appeals court judges and 20 district judges.

The U.S. Senate is preparing to move forward on October 12, 2020 with confirmation hearings on the controversial nomination of conservative federal appeals judge Amy Coney Barrett to fill the Supreme Court vacancy caused by the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. If confirmed, Judge Barrett would shift the center of the Court farther to the right, solidifying the hold of a conservative majority that has become increasingly hostile to constitutional challenges to death sentences and executions. Her nomination also raises questions as to future direction of the Court on a range of social justice issues, including electoral representation, voting rights, access to abortion, and accountability for police and prosecutorial misconduct. President Donald J. Trump announced Judge Barrett’s nomination on September 26, eight days after the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, in a Rose Garden ceremony and reception that has been likened to a COVID-19 “superspreader event.”

On campaign trail, vulnerable GOP senators play down a more conservative Supreme Court The GOP candidates are minimizing the impact of a Justice Amy Coney Barrett. The nomination of Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court marks a chance for the GOP to secure a decisive 6-3 conservative majority and accomplish long-held priorities for years to come. With her conservative voting record and a judicial philosophy calling for a strict interpretation of the Constitution, Barrett would likely move the court solidly to the right -- and potentially cast a deciding vote to overturn or restrict Roe v. Wade, which enshrined a woman's right to an abortion, and invalidate the Affordable Care Act.

How Amy Coney Barrett's Confirmation Would Compare To Past Supreme Court Picks President Trump's selection of Judge Amy Coney Barrett as his nominee to fill the Supreme Court seat left vacant by the death of Ruth Bader Ginsburg came just 38 days before the presidential election on Nov. 3. The move to have her on the court by then has ignited a major partisan battle on Capitol Hill. Democrats have lambasted Trump and Republicans for moving forward with the nomination so close to the election, especially when the Republican-led Senate in 2016 refused to hold hearings for then-President Barack Obama's nominee, Merrick Garland, nearly eight months before that year's election.

President Donald Trump nominated her to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit on Nov. 2, 2017. He then nominated her to the Supreme Court, just under three years later, on Sept. 26, 2020.

Defending his early response to the coronavirus pandemic, President Donald Trump wrongly claimed that in late February, Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, was saying, “This is no problem. In a Feb. 29 interview, Fauci said that “right now at this moment” the risk was “low” and there was “no need” for people “to change anything that you’re doing on a day-by-day basis.” But he added that “this could change,” that people needed to be wary of “community spread,” and that it could develop into a “major outbreak.” Trump’s comment came in response to a question about press reports that he ignored warnings about the growing threat of the coronavirus in more than a dozen classified intelligence briefings included in the President’s Daily Brief in January and February.

Reporter, April 28: Mr. President, can you clarify what your intelligence advisers were telling you back in January and February? Were you warned about what was happening with coronavirus and the threat to this country? Should there have been stronger warnings? Trump: Yeah, yeah. Well, I think probably a lot more to the Democrats, because a month later, Nancy Pelosi was saying, “Let’s dance in the streets of Chinatown.” You go back and you take a look at — even professionals, like Anthony [Fauci], were saying this is no problem.

It wasn’t until two weeks later, on March 16, that Trump imposed social distancing guidelines. One could question whether Fauci was slow to publicly call on the federal government to enact those guidelines. But Fauci’s comments in late February were far different from Trump’s claim that Fauci said, “This is no problem. FactCheck.org does not accept advertising.

“It’s not so much a question of if this will happen anymore,” she said, “but rather more a question of exactly when this will happen and how many people in this country will have severe illness.” On Feb. 28, Messonnier reported that there were three confirmed cases of person-to-person spread in the United States. She said that while “the immediate risk to the general American public remains low … [o]ur guidelines and advice are likely to be interim and subject to change as we learn more.” At a press conference on Feb. 29, the afternoon after his “Today” show interview, Fauci reiterated that the country as a whole, at that time, “still remains at low risk.

You’ve got to watch out because although the risk is low now, you don’t need to change anything you’re doing. When you start to see community spread, this could change and force you to become much more attentive to doing things that would protect you from spread. Welker: Dr. Fauci, quickly, how does this all end? Fauci: You know, it ends if you — it depends on the nature of the outbreak. I mean, this could be a major outbreak.

- Biden did not “apologize” for criticizing the China travel restrictions. His campaign on April 3 said Biden supported Trump’s decision to impose travel restrictions on China, and argued that Biden’s comments about “Donald Trump’s record of hysteria and xenophobia” — made the same day as Trump announced the travel restrictions — were not a reference to those restrictions. But here we’ll focus on Trump’s claim that in late February, “even professionals, like Anthony [Fauci], were saying this is no problem” and “this is going to blow over.” This isn’t the first time Trump has misleadingly cited Fauci’s late February assessments of the virus. On April 12, Trump retweeted a post by DeAnna Lorraine — a recently defeated California Republican congressional candidate — in which Lorraine claimed that “Fauci was telling people on February 29th that there was nothing to worry about and it posed no threat to the US public at large.”

But when we say that, we want to underscore that this is an evolving situation.” Fauci, Feb. 29: But as we say this, we need to prepare for further challenges. And we will have them. You will hear about additional cases that will be coming on. You should not be surprised by that, but to realize that that is something that is anticipated when you get community spread. So when you have cases throughout the world, the way we’re seeing now — South Korea, Italy, Iran and places like that — the United States cannot be completely immune to that.
		

Can you provide the source or context in which President Trump attributed the quote “This is not a threat. This is not a problem. Don’t worry about it.” to Dr. Anthony Fauci regarding the pandemic?		
I hope not. Or it could be something that’s reasonably well controlled. At the end of the day, this will ultimately go down. Hopefully we could protect the American public from any serious degree of morbidity or mortality. That’s the reason why we’ve got to do the things that we have in our plan. Fauci’s comments came as concerns were just starting to emerge in the U.S. about “community spread,” meaning that the “source of infection is unknown,” as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention explains, and the virus may have been transmitted person-to-person from someone in the U.S., rather than by exposure to an infected traveler who had brought it to the U.S. On Feb. 26, Nancy Messonnier, the director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said in a telebriefing that the CDC fully anticipated seeing community spread of the virus within U.S. borders.

Should we be changing our habits and, if so, how? Fauci: No. Right now, at this moment, there’s no need to change anything that you’re doing on a day-by-day basis. Right now the risk is still low, but this could change. I’ve said that many times even on this program.

Fact check: Harris' statement on Lincoln's Supreme Court nomination misses key details The claim: Harris' story about why Lincoln waited to fill a vacancy on the Supreme Court is wrong. The question of when the late-Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's seat will be filled by a nominee of the president's choosing was up for debate immediately after her death last month. It was an unavoidable topic during the first vice presidential debate on Oct. 7.
		

What specific statement by Harris regarding Lincoln's Supreme Court nomination is being referenced, and what key details are reportedly missing?		
Indeed, Harris' history lesson on Lincoln missed key details. Did Lincoln delay filling a seat on the Supreme Court? Presidential historian Michael Beschloss tweeted on the night of the debate that Harris was right. ""Harris is correct that when Roger Taney died in October 1864, Abraham Lincoln deferred a Supreme Court appointment until after election so that next President, with a new mandate, could do it, Beschloss said.

We rate this claim TRUE, based on our research. Lincoln delayed filling a vacancy on the Supreme Court that arose 27 days before the election of 1864.

More: Mitt Romney reprimands Trump, Democrats for 'vile' and 'hate-filled' politics But other evidence points to Lincoln being a savvy politician instead of a populist by deciding to delay a nomination for Taney's replacement before a major election. The Lincoln administration considered options before the chronically ill chief justice's death, but the Civil War and a historic election factored into the timing of naming a successor, according to ""Abraham Lincoln’s Appointments to the Supreme Court: A Master Politician at his Craft"" by Michael A.

The Police administration in Nigeria has dissolved the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) unit which has gained notoriety for using brute force in its operation. The dissolution of the unit comes on the back of massive protests across the country by mostly young people who lament consistent harassment, killing, torture, unfair criminal profiling and unlawful arrests of SARS officers. A tweet by the Nigeria Police Force on Sunday said “The Inspector General of Police has dissolved the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) across the Thirty-Six (36) State Commands and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) with immediate effects.” The tweet said an investigative team will be set up to investigate alleged crimes by SARS officers and “culprits will be punished.”

Given a recurring cycle in Nigeria of public outrage leading to government pledges that are then perceived not to have brought about tangible change, the announcement was greeted by a mixture of euphoria that the authorities had been forced to act and frustration that the measures did not go far enough.

Mr. Adamu, in a televised address, announced the dissolution of the Federal Special Anti-Robbery Squad, a notorious unit of the police beset by years of extra-judicial murders and corruption. Mr. Adamu said SARS agents to other police formations, commands and units, handed the Nigerian people a major victory in their quest to end decades of police brutality.
		

What specific actions did the daughters of President Muhammadu Buhari and Vice President Yemi Osinbajo take that directly led to the dissolution of the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) in Nigeria?		
This campaign was crowdfunded by the local tech industry. But never before has the resolve among Nigerians to not only #EndSARS but also bring about substantial reform across every unit of the local police force been this strong. That is why even after the nationwide protests forced the current Inspector-General of Police, Mohammed Adamu, to announce the “dissolution” of SARS in a televised briefing on Sunday, October 11, Nigerians are still out in their numbers protesting peacefully and demanding real change. That’s probably because SARS has been “banned and disbanded” many times before, but they have continued to wreak havoc.

He also asks the National Human Rights Commission of Nigeria to create a special panel to investigate previous wrongdoing by Sars

112,The Median White Household Wealth In The US Is 81 Times that of The Black Median Household Wealth,"What is the most recent data on the ratio of median household wealth between white and Black households in the United States, according to reputable sources such as the Federal Reserve or research institutions?		
The median wealth of white households is 20 times that of black households and 18 times that of Hispanic households, according to a Pew Research Center analysis of newly available government data from 2009. These lopsided wealth ratios are the largest since the government began publishing such data a quarter century ago and roughly twice the size of the ratios that had prevailed between these three groups for the two decades prior to the Great Recession that ended in 2009. The Pew Research analysis finds that, in percentage terms, the bursting of the housing market bubble in 2006 and the recession that followed from late 2007 to mid-2009 took a far greater toll on the wealth of minorities than whites. From 2005 to 2009, inflation-adjusted median wealth fell by 66% among Hispanic households and 53% among black households, compared with just 16% among white households.

Among households with wealth, Black median household wealth hovered between 5% and 17%  of the level of White household wealth between 1989 and 2016.

Just how large and persistent are these racial wealth gaps? As figure 1 shows, median net worth for white households has far exceeded that of Black households through recessions and booms over the last thirty years. While movements in white wealth are easier to see due to the larger scale, during the most recent economic downturn, median net worth declined by more for Black families (44.3 percent decline from 2007 to 2013) than for white families (26.1 percent decline). In fact, the ratio of white family wealth to Black family wealth is higher today than at the start of the century. Median wealth—or the wealth of the household at the middle of a distribution—gives the experience of the typical family, but does not reflect the bulk of national wealth that is held by the richest households.

Additionally, the ratio of average black wealth to average white wealth never exceeded 21.6 percent in 1992. Roughly speaking, the best-case scenario for the past 30 years occurred when blacks had about one-sixth the median wealth of whites in 1998. But in the wake of the Great Recession, which lasted from 2007 through 2009, America has seen its black-white wealth gap increase sharply and move even farther away from that best-case scenario. In 2016, median black wealth stood at $13,460—about half of the median black wealth recorded just before the Great Recession.

Worse still, median white wealth (wealth for the family in the exact middle of the overall distribution—wealthier than half of all families and less-wealthy than half) is twelve times higher than median black wealth. More than one in four black households have zero or negative net worth, compared to less than one in ten white families without wealth, which explains the large differences in the racial wealth gap at the mean and median.

They found that masks likely reduced infection, though they acknowledge that they didn't have enough participants to strongly conclude anything. Since the COVID-19 pandemic, this research group has done a systematic review of the effectiveness of masks7, including their 2015 study. “community mask use by well people could be beneficial, particularly for COVID-19, where transmission may be pre-symptomatic. The studies of masks as source control also suggest a benefit, and may be important during the COVID-19 pandemic in universal community face mask use as well as in health care settings.”
		

What do peer-reviewed studies or health organization data indicate about the effectiveness of mask-wearing in reducing COVID-19 transmission and infection rates among mask wearers compared to non-mask wearers?		
First, the study is on different diseases in different conditions (see last two paragraphs). Second, the study tested the effectiveness of masks at protecting the wearer (in this case healthcare workers), rather than source control, which is the primary purpose of masks in the COVID-19 pandemic. Third, the study did not have a ""no mask"" control, so they have no way of comparing cloth mask with no mask. The authors make this clear in the ""Strengths and limitations"" section of their paper, which appears adjacent to the abstract when you download the PDF. Importantly, the same research group did a study the following year on the effectiveness of masks at reducing infection when worn by sick individuals41.
		

What do peer-reviewed studies or health organization data indicate about the effectiveness of mask-wearing in reducing COVID-19 transmission and infection rates among mask wearers compared to non-mask wearers?		
They emphasized that other preventative measures such as physical distancing, washing hands, and staying home would be more effective than purely relying on masks136. In the current pandemic, the consensus is growing that public masking should be used in combination with other efforts rather than not at all1,5,7,10,126,133,136. Even the cautious and consensus-driven World Health Organization, which initially recommended against masks, now encourages their use in areas of widespread COVID-19 transmission137, in light of new information on the disease and the results of large-scale comparative studies135. We generated an initial list of studies using Google Scholar and Web of Science. We focused this initial search on studies specifically dealing with COVID-19 and masks.
		

What do peer-reviewed studies or health organization data indicate about the effectiveness of mask-wearing in reducing COVID-19 transmission and infection rates among mask wearers compared to non-mask wearers?		
- In the first few months of the pandemic, there was scientific uncertainty about the usefulness of public masking. Conflicting guidance was given by several official sources1–4. - There is now convincing evidence from multiple controlled experiments5–7 and field observations8–14 that wearing masks reduces the transmission of COVID-19 for healthcare workers and the public. Most of this evidence is COVID-19 specific and has emerged in the past few months1,8,15,16.

What do peer-reviewed studies or health organization data indicate about the effectiveness of mask-wearing in reducing COVID-19 transmission and infection rates among mask wearers compared to non-mask wearers?		
The fear is that someone wearing a mask might be more likely to engage in risky behaviors and therefore put themselves and others at higher risk of infection134. Furthermore, if masks are not worn or cleaned properly, they can result in “self-contamination”18, as discussed previously. While there is no evidence that masks cause fungal or bacterial infections130, the more humid habitat created by a mask may allow SARS-CoV-2 to remain active and possibly lead to the defeat of innate immunity and subsequent infection and transmission70. In past situations with less virulent diseases and lower levels of community spread, experts expressed caution when extending the successes of mask-wearing to large interpersonal contexts such as schools or healthcare settings41,54,135.
		

What do peer-reviewed studies or health organization data indicate about the effectiveness of mask-wearing in reducing COVID-19 transmission and infection rates among mask wearers compared to non-mask wearers?		
The research cited in this report comes from independent medical teams from around the world. Having multiple groups investigate the same question and comparing their independent conclusions increases the reliability of the science. To make it easier for you to evaluate the strength of this evidence, we have compiled PDFs of each cited study in this online folder. To get started, here are five of the most definitive scientific studies on public masking and COVID-19: For general background, here are 4 fact-checked resources:
		

What do peer-reviewed studies or health organization data indicate about the effectiveness of mask-wearing in reducing COVID-19 transmission and infection rates among mask wearers compared to non-mask wearers?		
We show that mask mandates are associated with a statistically significant decrease in daily new cases (−3.24 per 100K), deaths (−0.19 per 100K), and the proportion of hospital admissions (−2.47%) due to COVID-19 between February 1 and September 27, 2020. These effects are large, corresponding to 13% of the highest recorded number of cases, 20% of deaths, and 7% of admission proportion. We also find that mask mandates are linked to a 23.4 percentage point increase in mask adherence in four diverse states, and that mask adherence is associated with improved COVID-19 outcomes. Lastly, using a large novel survey in 68 countries, we find that community mask adherence and attitudes towards masks are associated with a reduction in COVID-19 cases and deaths.
		

What do peer-reviewed studies or health organization data indicate about the effectiveness of mask-wearing in reducing COVID-19 transmission and infection rates among mask wearers compared to non-mask wearers?		
- Researchers from hospitals, universities, the private sector, and government agencies have concluded that masks could be one of the most powerful and cost-effective tools to stop COVID-19 and accelerate the economic recovery1,5,10,11,16,23,25. There is universal agreement, however, that masking alone will not be enough to stop the pandemic. Masking is most effective when combined with physical distancing, frequent handwashing, rapid testing, and coordinated contact tracing1,8,26. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by a respiratory virus named “severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2” (SARS-CoV-2). It is in the same family as the virus that caused the SARS outbreak of 2003, and both of the viruses appear to have originally come from bats27,28 .
		

What do peer-reviewed studies or health organization data indicate about the effectiveness of mask-wearing in reducing COVID-19 transmission and infection rates among mask wearers compared to non-mask wearers?		
As we evaluated the evidence from multiple studies, we gave more weight to those that dealt specifically with the current outbreak, while still considering the other studies for context. One specific study is worth mentioning here, because of how often it is brought up in discussions of masks: MacIntyre and others 2015, ""Facemasks for the prevention of infection in healthcare and community settings. ""40 This study is often brought up as evidence that masks (especially cloth masks) don't work, and that they might actually cause harm (increase risk of infection). On first read of the abstract, it is easy to get this impression. However, this is a completely incorrect interpretation of this research for several reasons.

In which speech or interview did Joe Biden say, ""You know, we have to come together. That’s why I’m running. I’m running as a proud Democrat for the Senate. So vote! Vote!""?		
[BIDEN LAUGHS] — well, you have said, “I have no empathy for it. Give me a break.” In terms of things that they’ve been concerned about, with the way in which the older generations have probably, older generations have made things worse for them as a generation. In an interview with The Los Angeles Times, Mr. Biden said that he often hears from “the younger generation” about “how tough things are.” He said: “I have no empathy for it. Give me a break. Because here’s the deal guys, we decided we were going to change the world. And we did. We did. We finished the civil rights movement in the first stage. The women’s movement came into being.”

MC: So now your message is more you’re running on experience, a restoration of sanity, invocations of the Obama era. How do you convince younger voters that you are the person to help move the party into the future? So that’s a bit of a nostalgia thing. No. By the way, just so you know, my message isn’t that I’m going to return to the Obama era. My message is twofold. Number one, the next president of the United States, I think you’d all have to admit, is going to have to be able to do two things.

KK: Under the Obama administration, Silicon Valley’s power actually expanded greatly. There are very few mergers blocked.

If I only get to do one thing, could wave a wand and say I could solve one problem, that’s the first one I solve because unless we solve that one, none of the rest matters a whole lot. We’re not going to be able to unite the country. And if we can’t unite the country, this is all for naught.

In that context, we think a reasonable person would conclude that Biden was mocking Ryan’s plan, and that Biden was arguing Republicans would use it to justify cuts to Social Security and Medicare. “The Sanders campaign pushed a video and transcript that were intentionally, deceptively edited to make it seem like Vice President Biden was praising and agreeing with Paul Ryan, when it is clear he was doing the exact opposite,” a Biden campaign official told us. “In the speech, Biden was reiterating his core belief that we need to undo Trump’s tax cuts for the super wealthy and replace them with a tax code that rewards work, not just wealth. He warned that Republicans like Paul Ryan would use their tax cuts, which added trillions to the deficit, to argue for cuts to Social Security and Medicare — the kind of cuts he believes we have to fight tooth and nail.”

117,NASA always receives blessings from the Pope and that God’s permission must be sought before a space mission.,"Has there been any official statement or documented instance where the Pope or any Vatican official has explicitly stated that NASA must receive blessings or seek God's permission before conducting a space mission?		
Pope Benedict XVI had a direct line to the heavens Saturday, with NASA's help. Speaking from the Vatican, the pontiff bestowed a historic blessing upon the 12 astronauts circling Earth during the first-ever papal call to space, wishing a swift recovery for shuttle commander Mark Kelly's wounded congresswoman wife and condolences for a station astronaut mourning his mother's death. The ""extraordinary"" conversation, as Benedict described it, occurred after the Endeavour astronauts inspected a small gash in the shuttle's belly, to ensure their safe return to Earth after departing the International Space Station in just over a week. NASA later determined the damage posed no threat to the next-to-last flight in the 30-year shuttle program.
		

Has there been any official statement or documented instance where the Pope or any Vatican official has explicitly stated that NASA must receive blessings or seek God's permission before conducting a space mission?		
In 2011, Benedict XVI became the first pope to speak to astronauts in space. Sitting in the Vatican Library in Rome, the pope video-called Italian astronauts Paolo Nespoli and Roberto Vittori aboard the International Space Station, who were accompanied by ten other crewmembers from a U.S. and Russian space station. “This conversation gives me the chance to express my own admiration and appreciation to you and all those collaborating in making your mission possible, and offer my heartfelt encouragement to bring it to a safe and successful conclusion,” the pope said. Benedict XVI prepared a set of questions in English for the astronauts on a wide range of topics including the environment, war and faith. The pope called their voyage “an adventure of the human spirit” and asked whether, in the midst of their work and research, they ever stopped and prayed to the creator.
		

Has there been any official statement or documented instance where the Pope or any Vatican official has explicitly stated that NASA must receive blessings or seek God's permission before conducting a space mission?		
NASA provided technical support from Mission Control in Houston. Inside the ancient frescoed halls of the Vatican — where email wasn't even in wide use until a few years ago — the call was received with visible awe. The 84-year-old Benedict chuckled when one of the astronauts began floating up at the end of the transmission. He waved to the U.S., Italian and Russian crew at the beginning and end of the call.
		

Has there been any official statement or documented instance where the Pope or any Vatican official has explicitly stated that NASA must receive blessings or seek God's permission before conducting a space mission?		
In April 1970, Mission Commander Jim Lovell, aboard the troubled Apollo 13, spoke those words that shook a nation and the entire world. The spacecraft had experienced a malfunction, and the fate of its three passengers hung by the gravitational pull of celestial bodies. Back on earth – more precisely, in St. Peter’s Square at the Vatican – Pope Paul VI, along with more than 50,000 people gathered that day, bowed his head in prayer for the safe return of the astronauts. “We share in the universal trepidation for the fate of these spaceflight heroes in the unforeseen epilogue to their daring and unfortunate mission,” the pope told the faithful.
		

Has there been any official statement or documented instance where the Pope or any Vatican official has explicitly stated that NASA must receive blessings or seek God's permission before conducting a space mission?		
Paul VI had blessed the voyage of Apollo 11 on its departure on July 16, kept them in his prayers, and referred to the mission often during his weekly general audiences. As they departed on their historic voyage, the astronauts were carrying goodwill messages, including one from the pope praying “for this wonderful beginning,” and quoting Psalm 8 praising, “Lord, our Lord, how majestic is your name in all the earth!” The papal message remains on the moon to this day, buried next to the American flag. It was the time of the “Space Race” when technological developments followed one another at quick pace, creating a surge in innovation that still has ripple effects in the here and now.
		

Has there been any official statement or documented instance where the Pope or any Vatican official has explicitly stated that NASA must receive blessings or seek God's permission before conducting a space mission?		
The Vatican spokesman, the Rev. Federico Lombardi, said the call was evidence of the pope's desire to communicate with people however possible, be it sending a text message with a prayer of the day or a YouTube channel playing church teachings. Pope Paul VI sent a greeting to the moon with Apollo 11's Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin in 1969, but it was in a silicon disk that contained goodwill messages from numerous countries and was left on the Sea of Tranquility. ""I look up at your heavens, made by your fingers, at the moon and stars you set in place,"" said Paul VI, quoting from Psalms 8. Mission Control, meanwhile, was glowing. Flight controllers watched on monitors as the pope got set up for the interview.
		

Has there been any official statement or documented instance where the Pope or any Vatican official has explicitly stated that NASA must receive blessings or seek God's permission before conducting a space mission?		
Though O’Hair’s case was ultimately dismissed, it made an impression on NASA officials, who worried that any overtly religious display might open the agency up to another lawsuit. When Aldrin told the flight crew operations manager about his plans to broadcast his communion service, the manager told him to go ahead and have communion, but “keep your comments more general.” Though the press did report the fact that Aldrin would bring communion bread on the spacecraft, he kept the ceremony low-key and, out of respect for the debate over religion on the moon, kept the ceremony confined to the spacecraft and not the surface of the moon. Aldrin wasn’t the only astronaut to experience religious rituals in space. In 1994, three Catholic astronautstook Holy Communion on board Space Shuttle Endeavor.
		

Has there been any official statement or documented instance where the Pope or any Vatican official has explicitly stated that NASA must receive blessings or seek God's permission before conducting a space mission?		
Today – nearly 50 years later – as Pope Francis prepares to speak to six astronauts currently on the International Space Station on Oct. 26, it’s a good moment to look back at when popes sent prayers and tokens beyond Earth’s stratosphere, and the times when little pieces of the cosmos, taken from the unknown boundaries of space, made it back. Ground Control to Major Tom (ten, nine, eight, seven, six) Commencing countdown, engines on (five, four, three) Check ignition and may God’s love be with you (two, one, liftoff)
		

Has there been any official statement or documented instance where the Pope or any Vatican official has explicitly stated that NASA must receive blessings or seek God's permission before conducting a space mission?		
The Catholic Church has been at the forefront of fostering curiosity about space from early on. The Gregorian calendar, which we use today to calculate the time the planet takes to orbit around the sun, was promulgated by Pope Gregory XIII, and at least 35 craters on the surface of the moon are named after Jesuit scientists who advanced humanity’s understanding of the universe. When thinking of the Church’s relationship with space, one cannot forget to mention Blessed Paul VI. In the summer papal residence of Castel Gandolfo, on the night between the 20th and 21st of July 1969, Paul VI looked to the heavens through the lenses of the Vatican Observatory telescope. The pope, like the rest of the world, was waiting in anticipation for the moment when man would, for the first time, walk on the moon.
		

Has there been any official statement or documented instance where the Pope or any Vatican official has explicitly stated that NASA must receive blessings or seek God's permission before conducting a space mission?		
Seated at a table before a television set tuned to NASA's live broadcast from orbit, Benedict told the space travelers that ""you are our representatives spearheading humanity's exploration of new spaces and possibilities for our future."" He said he admired their courage, discipline and commitment. ""It must be obvious to you how we all live together on one Earth and how absurd it is that we fight and kill each one,"" the pontiff said, reading from prepared remarks. ""I know that Mark Kelly's wife was a victim of a serious attack, and I hope her health continues to improve.""

The survey was conducted across 13 Arab countries, including Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Iraq between November 2019 and September 2020. “In fact, one half of those who accepted formal diplomatic relations with Israel and their governments made such a move conditional on the formation of an independent Palestinian state,” the report finds. Until now, none of the Arab normalisation deals with Israel, including the latest UAE-Bahrain agreement, have laid out conditions related to Israeli acceptance of the Palestinian state. Among the countries, the highest opposition to any Arab normalisation came from Algeria, a north African state, which had gone through a terrible colonial experience under France similar to what the Palestinians have long experienced at the hands of Israelis.

The state of Israel will have a democratic political system whereby Israeli law formally guarantees equality of Arab Israeli citizens, who will have equal rights as Israeli Jews by law. Among the Palestinians, support stands at 33%. Among Israeli Jews: 60% support this, and 70% of Arab respondents. - A multinational force will be established and deployed in the Palestinian state to ensure the security and safety of both sides. Among Palestinians, 34% support this component; Israeli Jews support stands at 53% - a 6-point drop from 2020, and Israeli Arab support at 57%.

In Jordan, a country, which recognised Israel in 1994 in the wake of the Oslo Peace Accords between Israelis and Palestinians, the opposition to any normalisation with Tel Aviv is one of the highest across the Arab world, hitting at 93 percent. Popular opposition to the normalisation with Israel is very strong in the Gulf, where the Arab autocrat sentiment to warm relations with the Zionist state runs high in regard to other Middle Eastern regions. The average opposition to Arab-Israeli normalisation is hitting its highest degree in the Gulf, according to the poll. “Refusal to recognise Israel is proportionally the highest in the Gulf region; nearly 90% of Qatar and Kuwait respondents reject their country’s recognition of Israel, and 65% of Saudis expressed their rejection, as contrasted with 6% who agreed to recognition, while 29% refused to express their opinion,” the report says.

Moreover, the same survey shows that since 2011, over 84 percent of Arab publics reject their home countries’ diplomatic recognition of Israel. If Arab governments were to pursue normalization now, as they are faced with a growing number of threats, the consequences could be severe in terms of internal unrest. Such a policy would anger large parts of the Arab public as well as provide legitimizing evidence for radical groups in the region, which often make the claim that they alone are the true representatives of Arab/Muslim causes. It is also likely that normalization with Israel would serve to isolate Arab governments further and weaken their soft power and legitimacy in the region.
		

What percentage of Arab citizens support normalization with Israel according to recent and reliable surveys or studies?		
Among Israeli Jews, support for this one equal state stands at 20%, compared to 44% among Israeli Arabs. But, as shown in the following figure, current support of Israeli Jews for one unequal or non-democratic state, at 37%, compared to 35% in 2020, is higher than the current support for the two-state solution. Israeli Arabs were asked the same question as Palestinians, about support and opposition for one unequal and undemocratic state of Palestine in which Jews do not have full citizen rights.: 20% of Israeli Arabs expressed support and 46% opposition; 34% did not know or did not provide an answer.

What percentage of Arab citizens support normalization with Israel according to recent and reliable surveys or studies?		
But a much larger minority of Israeli Arabs, 44%, expressed the view that a majority of Israeli Jews support it. These assessments have declined somewhat from previous surveys since 2016. In 2020, 18% had optimistic impressions compared to 23% in 2018 and 36% before that. However, the perception of majority support is lower than reality; in fact, 31% of Jews support the total two-state package in the current survey – more than double the portion who believe a majority of Jews support it. In other words, the minority of Israeli Jews who support the package thinks it is much smaller than it is in reality.

Australia, until 60s, Aborigines came under the Flora And Fauna Act, classified them as animals, not human beings. Archived post. New comments cannot be posted and votes cannot be cast.
		

What is the original name and content of the legislation commonly referred to as ""The Flora and Fauna Act"" that classified Aboriginal people as animals, and when was it overturned?		
The ""Flora and Fauna Act"" myth is a belief often repeated in public debate that Indigenous Australians were classified as fauna by legislation, specifically under a “Flora and Fauna Act”, and managed as such by the Australian and State Governments, and that the legislation and practice was overturned by a change to the Australian Constitution implemented by the 1967 referendum about Aboriginal affairs. A fact check conducted by ABC News in 2018 found ""Aboriginal people in Australia have never been covered by a flora and fauna act, either under federal or state law"".[1] Law professor Helen Irving has identified the ""Flora and Fauna Act"" myth as part of a series of myths about the 1967 referendum and the evolution of Aboriginal civil rights in general.[2] In 2003, Linda Burney, the first Aboriginal woman elected to the New South Wales Legislative Assembly and Australian House of Representatives, incorrectly claimed in her maiden speech that she had spent the first ten years of her life under the Flora and Fauna Act.[1] Burney's comments led to the increased proliferation of the ""Flora and Fauna Act"" myth.[3][4]
		

What is the original name and content of the legislation commonly referred to as ""The Flora and Fauna Act"" that classified Aboriginal people as animals, and when was it overturned?		
So, is it true that Indigenous Australians were classified according to a flora and fauna act until the 1967 referendum? Aboriginal people in Australia have never been covered by a flora and fauna act, either under federal or state law. But despite several attempts by various people to set the record straight, the myth continues to circulate, perhaps because, as one academic told Fact Check, it ""embodies elements of a deeper truth about discrimination"". Although the claim has been repeated more frequently during the past 10 years, there is evidence to suggest the myth originated in the early 1970s.
		

What is the original name and content of the legislation commonly referred to as ""The Flora and Fauna Act"" that classified Aboriginal people as animals, and when was it overturned?		
I can’t find a “Flora and Fauna Act” in any jurisdiction or any similarly named act. There was a Fauna Protection Act (NSW) (1940s from memory) but it doesn’t seem relevant. I had originally assumed that the Commonwealth had done some “back door” regulation of aboriginal matters via a nature protection act of some kind, but that doesn’t seem to be the case. http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/num_act/fpa1964n50291.pdf?

What is the original name and content of the legislation commonly referred to as ""The Flora and Fauna Act"" that classified Aboriginal people as animals, and when was it overturned?		
However, Aboriginal people still had to apply for citizenship and meet certain criteria. Meeting this criteria meant removing themselves from their community and culture. It is sometimes stated that the 1967 Referendum overturned a ‘Flora and Fauna Act’. This supposed act classed Aboriginal people alongside native Australian flora and fauna. While no such act ever existed, the New South Wales National Parks and Wildlife Act 1974 may have encouraged this belief. This Act gave the NSW government control over Aboriginal heritage and landscape.
		

What is the original name and content of the legislation commonly referred to as ""The Flora and Fauna Act"" that classified Aboriginal people as animals, and when was it overturned?		
It would certainly be useful to get this regulation on the record if it was once indeed the case. Does anyone know where the claim originates? Update, September 2014: More than a year after posting, there is no evidence that there ever was a Flora and Fauna Act anywhere in Australia. There was certainly no Commonwealth act. The closest thing uncovered in comments below is the NSW National Parks and Wildlife Act 1967, which among many other things legislated on some aboriginal cultural heritage issues. It may be that concern over NSW regulation of Aboriginal artifacts morphed into the claim that indigenous people themselves were controlled by the Act.
		

What is the original name and content of the legislation commonly referred to as ""The Flora and Fauna Act"" that classified Aboriginal people as animals, and when was it overturned?		
The myth that the Constitution included a reference to the Aboriginal people under a “flora and fauna” section is entirely erroneous. The words “flora and fauna” do not appear anywhere in the Constitution, nor did they prior to 1967. There was no “Flora and Fauna Act” either. No legislation referred to or classified the Aboriginal people in such terms. It is sometimes thought that the “White Australia” policy was enshrined in the Constitution and/or directed at Aboriginal people.
		

What is the original name and content of the legislation commonly referred to as ""The Flora and Fauna Act"" that classified Aboriginal people as animals, and when was it overturned?		
Fact Check: Were Indigenous Australians classified under a flora and fauna act until the 1967 referendum? A regularly repeated claim in public debate is that Indigenous Australians were covered by a flora and fauna act, which did not classify them as human beings, and that this only changed when the constitution was amended following the 1967 referendum. On TV, Indigenous actor Shareena Clanton claimed her mother was not ""considered a human being until the referendum came through from the flora and fauna act in 1967"". RMIT ABC Fact Check found her claim is a myth. Aboriginal people in Australia have never been covered by a flora and fauna act, either under federal or state law.

Both claims serve to distance the Confederacy from its core justification and suggest United States hypocrisy on the matter of race. Robert E. Lee personally owned slaves that he inherited upon the death of his mother, Ann Lee, in 1829. (His son, Robert E. Lee Jr., gave the number as three or four families.) Following the death of his father-in-law, George Washington Parke Custis, in 1857, Lee assumed command of 189 enslaved people, working the estates of Arlington, White House, and Romancoke. Custis’ will stipulated that the enslaved people that the Lee family inherited be freed within five years.

Did Robert E. Lee own slaves during his lifetime, and if so, how many and for how long?		
Robert E. Lee was a Confederate general who led the South’s attempt at secession during the Civil War. He challenged Union forces during the war’s bloodiest battles, including Antietam and Gettysburg, before surrendering to Union General Ulysses S. Grant in 1865 at Appomattox Court House in Virginia, marking the end of the devastating conflict that nearly split the United States. Robert Edward Lee was born in Stratford Hall, a plantation in Virginia, on January 19, 1807, to a wealthy and socially prominent family. His mother, Anne Hill Carter, also grew up on a plantation and his father, Colonel Henry “Light Horse Harry” Lee, was descended from colonists and become a Revolutionary War leader and three-term governor of Virginia.
		

Did Robert E. Lee own slaves during his lifetime, and if so, how many and for how long?		
As confederate monuments are removed from public spaces all over the nation, many Americans are forced to examine long-held beliefs about leaders from one of the country’s most complicated and painful moments: the Civil War. Harvard historian Nancy Koehn joined Boston Public Radio today to talk about the legacy of one confederate general, Robert E. Lee. According to Koehn, Lee was some combination of the well-loved general and vicious slave owner that history has remembered him as. “The truth about Robert E. Lee, like most historical truth, lies in the middle and is complicated,” said Koehn.
		

Did Robert E. Lee own slaves during his lifetime, and if so, how many and for how long?		
CLAIM: Gen. Robert E. Lee, who led the Confederate States Army in the Civil War, “opposed both secession and slavery.” AP’S ASSESSMENT: False. According to historians, not only did Lee own slaves, but he also fought in court to keep working slaves from his father-in-law’s estate. Claims casting Lee as an anti-slavery figure are tied to a false narrative known as the Lost Cause, which says the Confederate experience in the Civil War was not about slavery, but state’s rights. THE FACTS: As protests following the death of George Floyd lead to a reexamination of historical injustice, there’s been a campaign calling for monuments celebrating the Confederacy to be taken down.
		

Did Robert E. Lee own slaves during his lifetime, and if so, how many and for how long?		
This included managing close to 100 of the approximately 200 enslaved peoples that his father now legally possessed. By the start of the Civil War, Robert E. Lee had yet to free them as the Custis will dictated. During the war’s 1862 Peninsula Campaign, United States troops temporarily occupied White House plantation, with General George McClellan establishing his headquarters at the site because it lay astride a railroad running directly to the Confederate capital of Richmond. Thus, Northerners came in close contact there with the plantation’s enslaved community.

Did Robert E. Lee own slaves during his lifetime, and if so, how many and for how long?		
As a result of his father-in-law, Lee became owner of hundreds of enslaved workers. While historical accounts vary, Lee’s treatment of the enslaved peoples was described as being so combative and harsh that it led to revolts. During the 1850s, tensions between the abolitionist movement and slave owners reached a boiling point, and the union of states was near a breaking point. Lee entered the fray by halting a raid at Harpers Ferry in 1859, capturing radical abolitionist John Brown and his followers. The following year, Abraham Lincoln was elected president, prompting seven Southern states — Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina, and Texas — to secede in protest.
		

Did Robert E. Lee own slaves during his lifetime, and if so, how many and for how long?		
A career army officer, Lee didn't have much wealth, but he inherited a few slaves from his mother. Still, Lee married into one of the wealthiest slave-holding families in Virginia — the Custis family of Arlington and descendants of Martha Washington. When Lee's father-in-law died, he took leave from the U.S. Army to run the struggling estate and met resistance from slaves expecting to be freed. Documents show Lee was a cruel figure with his slaves and encouraged his overseers to severely beat slaves captured after trying to escape. One slave said Lee was one of the meanest men she had ever met.
		

Did Robert E. Lee own slaves during his lifetime, and if so, how many and for how long?		
But even if Lee owned few enslaved individuals in his own name, he became part of a large slaveholding household when he married Mary Anna Randolph Custis in 1831. Mary Custis Lee was the only surviving child of George Washington Parke Custis, the grandson of Martha Washington and the owner of three major plantations—Arlington, overlooking the Potomac River in the District of Columbia, and Romancoke and White House on the Pamunkey River—and 198 enslaved individuals by the 1850s. Thereafter, Lee had little need to acquire enslaved people himself, and the family’s summer vacation peregrinations to visit various relatives included, according to one 1839 account, “a squad of children, Negroes, horses, and dogs.” On the other hand, the various postings to which Lee was ordered after his marriage did not accommodate large numbers of enslaved people, especially in the North.

126,"Ulysses S. Grant, commander of the Union Army during the American Civil War, was a slave owner.","Did Ulysses S. Grant own slaves during his lifetime, and if so, at what point and under what circumstances?		
Editor’s note: This article was the history brief for the February 2014 meeting of the Cleveland Civil War Roundtable. One interesting piece of Civil War-related trivia is the last U.S. president who was a slaveowner for at least some time in his life. The perhaps surprising answer is Ulysses S. Grant. As far as is known, Grant owned only one slave in his lifetime, and he freed that slave even though at the time Grant was in a dire financial situation and could have made some much needed money by selling his slave. Grant came to own that slave through his wife’s family. When Ulysses Grant and Julia Dent married on August 22, 1848, Grant was pursuing a military career, having recently returned from the Mexican-American War.
		

Did Ulysses S. Grant own slaves during his lifetime, and if so, at what point and under what circumstances?		
The people of the North need not quarrel over the institution of Slavery. What Vice President Stevens [sic] acknowledges the corner stone of the Confederacy is already knocked out. Slavery is already dead and cannot be resurrected. It would take a standing Army to maintain slavery in the South if we were to make peace to-day guaranteeing to the South all their former constitutional privileges. 24 thoughts on “Did Ulysses S. Grant Own Slaves During the Civil War?” I had a rather interesting exchange on Twitter with a person who argued that Grant was essentially guilty by association for marrying into a slaveholding family.
		

Did Ulysses S. Grant own slaves during his lifetime, and if so, at what point and under what circumstances?		
Did Ulysses S. Grant own slaves during the Civil War? No, but it will come as a surprise to many people, that Grant did in fact own a man named William Jones for about a year on the eve of the Civil War. In 1859, Grant either bought or was given the 35-year-old Jones, who was in Grant’s service until he freed him before the start of the War. While Grant’s views on slavery evolved over time, his relationship with slavery was complicated and demonstrates the pervasiveness of the institution in antebellum America.
		

Did Ulysses S. Grant own slaves during his lifetime, and if so, at what point and under what circumstances?		
The former commanding general of the Union Army had kept a lone Black enslaved man named William Jones in the years before the Civil War, but gave him his freedom in 1859. Grant would later sum up his evolving views on slavery in 1878, when he was quoted as saying that it was “a stain to the Union” that people had once been “bought and sold like cattle.”
		

Did Ulysses S. Grant own slaves during his lifetime, and if so, at what point and under what circumstances?		
That is pretty much the heart of the matter regarding Grant’s alleged ownership of slaves during the war, but I believe there is other evidence that can further advance us towards a conclusive answer. Grant’s wife Julia grew up in a household that benefited from slave labor, a fact that Julia acknowledged and romanticized in her own Personal Memoirs. Julia claimed in her Memoirs that her father gave her legal title to four slaves to be used for her benefit, and no competent Grant historian would doubt that she and the entire Grant family benefited from their labor during their St. Louis years. There’s no evidence to suggest that Julia ever held legal title of a slave, however, suggesting that they were always her father’s slaves.
		

Did Ulysses S. Grant own slaves during his lifetime, and if so, at what point and under what circumstances?		
As a result, Ulysses Grant was the last U.S. president to have owned an enslaved individual. Grant’s legacy as the respected Commanding General of the Union Army, and his efforts as president to protect black citizenship have long obscured his personal slave-ownership, as well as that of his beloved wife. Julia Dent Grant’s interactions with slavery are well-documented in her personal memoirs, first published in 1975. Her father, Frederick Dent, purchased a plantation in St. Louis, Missouri, in 1820.1 The plantation, called White Haven, ran using enslaved labor; Dent oversaw a workforce of approximately thirty enslaved individuals on two Missouri properties.2 In 1830, when Julia was only four years old, there were at least eighteen enslaved individuals at White Haven.3 In her reminiscences, she described growing up surrounded by enslaved servants like Henrietta, Sue, and Jeff, whom she considered playmates during her childhood, before assuming control over them in adulthood: We always had a dusky train of from eight to ten little colored girls of all hues, and these little colored girls were allowed to accompany us… we would wander by the brookside, catch minnows with pin-hooks…I, being of very provident nature, required these little maids to each carry a bucket to bring home my captives.4

I have addressed this question more in depth on my website. https://pastexplore.wordpress.com/2015/06/29/did-ulysses-s-grant-own-slaves-during-the-civil-war/ Thank you so much for this prompt response. Irony abounds! But it was also a different time, culturally, so I know my standards and convictions don’t apply as neatly to 1863 as to 2020. Oh – also- in the interest of accuracy – as I read on I realize the events I am describing took place in late 1862, not 1863. One person that many people overlook that may give an entirely different perspective is Henrietta Jones.
		

Did Ulysses S. Grant own slaves during his lifetime, and if so, at what point and under what circumstances?		
Many visitors to Ulysses S. Grant National Historic Site are surprised to learn that enslaved African Americans lived and worked on the nineteenth century slave plantation known as White Haven. During the years 1854 to 1859 Grant lived here with his wife, Julia, and their children, managing the slave plantation for his father-in-law, Colonel Dent. At that time no one suspected that Grant would rise from obscurity to achieve the success he gained during the Civil war. However, his experience working alongside the White Haven enslaved may have influenced him in his later roles as the Union general who won the war which abolished that “peculiar institution,” and as President of the United States.

In addition to calling for approximately $4 trillion in higher federal taxes over the next decade, Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden and his running mate, Senator Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), have also endorsed Proposition 15, a state level tax hike on the November ballot that would raise the property tax burden for California employers by as much as $12 billion every year. Prop. 15 imposes a multi-billion dollar tax hike on California businesses by partially repealing the property tax limit put in place by Proposition 13, the historic property tax cap approved in 1978. Proposition 13, approved by California voters 42 years ago, caps annual increase in the taxable value of personal and commercial property at 2% or the rate of inflation, whichever is smaller. Proposition 15, if approved by voters this November, would repeal Prop. 13 protections for businesses with more than $3 million in combined property value, which is not a high bar to clear in California given the relatively high cost of real estate.

Sen. Bernie Sanders has unveiled his plan to directly tax the wealth of millionaires and billionaires — and it goes substantially further than Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s plan to do the same. The proposal would cut the wealth of billionaires in the United States in half in 15 years and entirely close the gap in wealth growth between billionaires and the average American family, according to University of California Berkeley economists Gabriel Zucman and Emmanuel Saez, who advised Sanders on his plan. Hitting the richest 180,000 American households, Saez and Zucman estimate the tax would raise $4.35 trillion over the next decade, which Sanders says would go toward paying for his biggest policies, including Medicare-for-all, affordable housing, and universal childcare. The wealth tax has been one of Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s signature policy proposals on the campaign trail, what she sells as a “two-cent tax” on the 75,000 wealthiest families in the country: She’s proposing a 2 percent tax on household assets above $50 million and 3 percent for households with assets worth more than $1 billion.

Whereas Warren’s plan has the same thresholds for individuals and married couples, which could enable some wealthy couples to evade the tax by getting divorced, Sanders’s plan closes that loophole. As Vox’s Matt Yglesias explained, most middle class Americans already pay a version of a wealth tax: a property tax to their local government on their homes, the most common asset among middle-income Americans. But property taxes don’t get at all the wealth super-rich people keep in stocks or other assets. Sanders also has a proposal to dramatically expand the estate tax, topping out at a maximum rate of 77 percent. Taxing the ultra-rich has become increasingly popular in progressive circles. This is in part a reaction to the drastic Trump tax cuts, which have not led to the kind of middle class income growth that was promised.

131,We do not know where Covid-19 places among causes of death because the data is not published.,"Is there publicly available data or reports from health organizations that categorize Covid-19 among causes of death, and if so, how is this data compiled and published?		
The National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) uses incoming data from death certificates to produce provisional COVID-19 death counts. These include deaths occurring within the 50 states and the District of Columbia. NCHS also provides summaries that examine deaths in specific categories and in greater geographic detail, such as deaths by county and by race and Hispanic origin. COVID-19 deaths are identified using a new ICD–10 code. When COVID-19 is reported as a cause of death – or when it is listed as a “probable” or “presumed” cause — the death is coded as U07.1.
		

Is there publicly available data or reports from health organizations that categorize Covid-19 among causes of death, and if so, how is this data compiled and published?		
Data on deaths due to pneumonia, influenza, and COVID-19 (International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision codes U07.1 or J09-J18) and on deaths due to all causes were obtained from the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) mortality surveillance system.10 Data were stratified by state and week. Data on all-cause deaths in previous years were obtained from https://data.cdc.gov/resource/pp7x-dyj2 and https://data.cdc.gov/resource/muzy-jte6. Data on all-cause deaths and pneumonia/influenza/COVID-19 deaths since January 26, 2020, were obtained from https://data.cdc.gov/resource/r8kw-7aab. The NCHS data are based on the state where the death occurred rather than the state of residence.
		

Is there publicly available data or reports from health organizations that categorize Covid-19 among causes of death, and if so, how is this data compiled and published?		
ICD provides the basic guidance used in virtually all countries to code and classify causes of death. It provides not only disease, injury, and poisoning categories but also the rules used to select the single underlying cause of death for tabulation from the several diagnoses that may be reported on a single death certificate, as well as definitions, tabulation lists, the format of the death certificate, and regulations on use of the classification. Causes of death for data presented in this report were coded according to ICD guidelines described in annual issues of Part 2a of the NCHS Instruction Manual (4). COVID-19 deaths are identified using the ICD–10 code U07.1. Deaths are coded to U07.1 when COVID-19 is reported as a cause that contributed to death on the death certificate.
		

Is there publicly available data or reports from health organizations that categorize Covid-19 among causes of death, and if so, how is this data compiled and published?		
Such a dataset reduces the risk of introducing numerator and denominator biases that can be problematic in analyses using unlinked data. More details on how the census and deaths records were linked can be found in the Technical appendix. Deaths were defined using the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10). Deaths involving COVID-19 include those with an underlying cause, or any mention, of ICD-10 codes U07.1 (COVID-19, virus identified) or U07.2 (COVID-19, virus not identified).Back to table of contents
		

Is there publicly available data or reports from health organizations that categorize Covid-19 among causes of death, and if so, how is this data compiled and published?		
Death counts are not tabulated by the decedent’s state of residence. COVID-19 deaths may also be classified or defined differently in various reporting and surveillance systems. Death counts in this report include laboratory confirmed COVID-19 deaths and clinically confirmed COVID-19 deaths. This includes deaths where COVID-19 is listed as a “presumed” or “probable” cause. Some local and state health departments only report laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 deaths. This may partly account for differences between NCHS reported death counts and death counts reported in other sources.
		

Is there publicly available data or reports from health organizations that categorize Covid-19 among causes of death, and if so, how is this data compiled and published?		
This information is presented by sex and age group. We are also presenting age-specific mortality rates for recent time periods and breakdowns of deaths involving the coronavirus (COVID-19) by associated pre-existing health conditions. The information used to produce these statistics is based on details collected when certified deaths are registered with the local registration office. The counts of deaths from specific conditions are updated with each weekly publication as the coding of the underlying cause is not always complete at the time of production. The doctor certifying a death can list all causes in the chain of events that led to the death and pre-existing conditions that may have contributed to the death.

Is there publicly available data or reports from health organizations that categorize Covid-19 among causes of death, and if so, how is this data compiled and published?		
Furthermore, if patients with chronic conditions turn away from the health care system because of concerns about potential COVID-19 infection, there could be increases in certain categories of deaths unrelated to COVID-19. In the midst of a large outbreak, there is also an unavoidable delay in the compilation of death certificates and ascertainment of causes of death. Overall, the degree of testing, criteria for attributing deaths to COVID-19, and the length of reporting delays are expected to vary between states, further complicating efforts to obtain an accurate count of deaths related to the pandemic. To estimate the mortality burden of a new infectious agent when there is a lack of comprehensive testing, it is common to assess increases in rates of death beyond what would be expected if the pathogen had not circulated.5-7 The “excess death” approach can be applied to specific causes of death directly related to the pathogen (eg, pneumonia or other respiratory conditions), or this approach can be applied to other categories of deaths that may be directly or indirectly influenced by viral circulation or pandemic interventions (eg, cardiac conditions, traffic injuries, or all causes).
		

Is there publicly available data or reports from health organizations that categorize Covid-19 among causes of death, and if so, how is this data compiled and published?		
These can include laboratory confirmed cases, as well as cases without laboratory confirmation. If the certifier suspects COVID-19 or determines it was likely (e.g., the circumstances were compelling within a reasonable degree of certainty), they can report COVID-19 as “probable” or “presumed” on the death certificate (5, 6). COVID-19 is listed as the underlying cause on the death certificate in 87% of deaths, but this varies from year to year (see Tables 1 and 2). Pneumonia deaths are identified using multiple cause-of-death codes from the 10th Revision of ICD (ICD–10): J12–J18, excluding deaths that involve influenza (J09–J11). Influenza deaths are identified from the ICD–10 codes J09–J11, and include deaths with pneumonia or COVID-19 listed as a contributing cause of death.

Source: Office for National Statistics – Deaths involving COVID-19 in the care sector - Based on deaths involving the coronavirus (COVID-19) rather than deaths where COVID-19 was the underlying cause of death. - Based on the date a death occurred rather than when it was registered. - The symptoms, signs and ill-defined conditions category includes deaths where no more specific diagnosis can be made.

135,No one lost their health care because of the Wellmark and Iowa Farm Bureau Health Plan Bill.,"Did the Wellmark and Iowa Farm Bureau Health Plan Bill result in any documented instances where individuals lost their health insurance coverage or experienced changes in their existing health plans?		
Besides resuming sales of its own individual policies next year, Wellmark plans to partner with the Iowa Farm Bureau Federation to sell a new kind of health coverage. However, those plans might not be offered to people who have pre-existing ailments and they won't qualify for federal subsidies to help pay premiums. Individual health insurance policies are for people without access to employer-provided coverage or government programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid. Less than 5 percent of Iowans buy them, but those consumers have been the most vulnerable to premium spikes and loss of coverage.
		

Did the Wellmark and Iowa Farm Bureau Health Plan Bill result in any documented instances where individuals lost their health insurance coverage or experienced changes in their existing health plans?		
By extension, Farm Bureau plans also would not have to meet federal ACA standards for health insurance as these apply only to policies sold by state licensed health insurers. The new Iowa law applies no other standards for Farm Bureau health plans – for example, it does not establish minimum benefit requirements, rating requirements, or rules prohibiting discrimination based on pre-existing health conditions. Appeal rights guaranteed to health insurance policyholders also would not apply to Farm Bureau enrollees, nor would state insurance solvency and other financial regulations. The law does require the Farm Bureau to administer coverage through a state licensed third party administrator, or TPA (expected to be Wellmark, Iowa’s Blue Cross Blue Shield insurer.)
		

Did the Wellmark and Iowa Farm Bureau Health Plan Bill result in any documented instances where individuals lost their health insurance coverage or experienced changes in their existing health plans?		
Among other things, the new Farm Bureau plans could exclude people with pre-existing health problems, such as diabetes or cancer. Critics predicted that would let the new Wellmark and Farm Bureau partnership “cherry pick” healthy customers, leaving other carriers to cover unhealthy ones. The new Farm Bureau/Wellmark plans won’t be eligible for Obamacare subsidies. Thams said they’re most likely to appeal to healthy Iowans who make too much money to qualify for the federal assistance. For a single person, the annual income limit to qualify for the subsidies is about $48,000.
		

Did the Wellmark and Iowa Farm Bureau Health Plan Bill result in any documented instances where individuals lost their health insurance coverage or experienced changes in their existing health plans?		
However, use of a TPA does not extend federal or state insurance law to the underlying Farm Bureau health plan. The Iowa law closely resembles a Tennessee state law, enacted in 1993, which authorized the sale of health coverage by the Farm Bureau and deemed such coverage not to be health insurance subject to state regulation. In Tennessee, it has been reported that roughly 25,000 residents purchase non-group Farm Bureau health plans that are medically underwritten. (By comparison, more than 228,000 residents have ACA-compliant individual policies through the Marketplace this year.)

Did the Wellmark and Iowa Farm Bureau Health Plan Bill result in any documented instances where individuals lost their health insurance coverage or experienced changes in their existing health plans?		
Congress, now led by Republicans who opposed Obamacare, decided last year to get rid of the penalty for failing to obtain coverage. Critics said the change could encourage some healthy Americans to stop buying insurance. The critics fear healthy customers’ exit could worsen the risk pool for remaining customers, increasing costs and tempting carriers to drop out of the business. But Bartsh said Medica, which is a relatively small carrier, decided to remain in the individual health insurance market in the six states where it’s selling this year, including Iowa. The Iowa situation became even more complicated this spring, when Iowa legislators approved a controversial plan to let Wellmark partner with the Iowa Farm Bureau Federation to sell 2019 policies that don’t comply with Affordable Care Act regulations or state rules.
		

Did the Wellmark and Iowa Farm Bureau Health Plan Bill result in any documented instances where individuals lost their health insurance coverage or experienced changes in their existing health plans?		
Wellmark is Iowa's dominant health insurance carrier, focusing mainly on coverage offered through employers. Iowa’s market for individual health insurance has been in turmoil for years. Last summer, many experts feared Iowa would be the only state to lack any carriers selling such policies. Aetna and Wellmark pulled out of Iowa’s individual health insurance market for 2018, citing financial losses and uncertain risks. Medica was the only remaining carrier, and its leaders said they were considering exiting as well. Medica decided at the last minute to continue selling individual policies in Iowa for 2018, but only by raising premiums an average of 57 percent.
		

Did the Wellmark and Iowa Farm Bureau Health Plan Bill result in any documented instances where individuals lost their health insurance coverage or experienced changes in their existing health plans?		
Medica objected to the bill allowing Wellmark and Farm Bureau to sell unregulated policies that technically aren’t health insurance. Medica said it was unfair for legislators to exempt one set of companies from regulations, but not other companies. However, the bill passed, and Gov. Kim Reynolds signed it. Medica considered challenging the new law in court, but Bartsh said Friday that the company has no plans to do so now. Iowa Insurance Commissioner Doug Ommen praised Friday's news. ""We greatly appreciate Medica’s willingness to stay in the market while we await federal action to allow Iowa the full flexibility it needs to restore the market,"" he wrote in an email to the Register.

In 2019, about 2% of Iowa's electricity net generation came from renewable energy resources other than wind. Biomass and solar energy each contributed a small amount the state's electricity, and almost all of the remaining renewable generation came from hydroelectric power.29 The largest of Iowa's three hydroelectric power plants—the Keokuk plant with 15 turbine-generator units and 142 megawatts of generating capacity—is more than 100 years old and the largest privately-owned and operated dam and hydroelectric plant on the Mississippi River.30,31 The state's biomass resources include landfill gas and agricultural biodigesters that produce methane gas that fuels generating facilities. Iowa's biomass resources also provide feedstock to the state's one wood pellet plant, which can process wood waste into up to 15,000 tons of pellets annually.32,33,34,35 A small, but growing, amount of solar power in the state mostly comes from customer-sited, small-scale generating systems.36 Iowa's best solar power resource potential is found in the southwestern corner of the state.37

137,it is unknown whether a person under 20 can pass the disease to an older adult.,"What is the age-related transmission rate of the disease from individuals under 20 to those who are older, according to current scientific studies?		
Early data from China suggested that people without symptoms could infect others.(6) To better understand the role of transmission from infected people without symptoms, it is important to distinguish between transmission from people who are infected who never develop symptoms(75) (asymptomatic transmission) and transmission from people who are infected but have not developed symptoms yet (pre-symptomatic transmission). This distinction is important when developing public health strategies to control transmission. The extent of truly asymptomatic infection in the community remains unknown. The proportion of people whose infection is asymptomatic likely varies with age due to the increasing prevalence of underlying conditions in older age groups (and thus increasing risk of developing severe disease with increasing age), and studies that show that children are less likely to show clinical symptoms compared to adults.(76) Early studies from the United States (77) and China (78) reported that many cases were asymptomatic, based on the lack of symptoms at the time of testing; however, 75-100% of these people later developed symptoms.
		

What is the age-related transmission rate of the disease from individuals under 20 to those who are older, according to current scientific studies?		
This is similar to what is seen with other respiratory illnesses, such as the flu (influenza). Each of these factors can increase the risk of severe COVID-19 symptoms. But people who have several of these other health problems are at even higher risk. People of any age can catch COVID-19. But it most commonly affects middle-aged and older adults. The risk of developing dangerous symptoms increases with age, with those who are age 85 and older are at the highest risk of serious symptoms. In the U.S., about 81% of deaths from the disease have been in people age 65 and older. Risks are even higher for older people when they have other health conditions.
		

What is the age-related transmission rate of the disease from individuals under 20 to those who are older, according to current scientific studies?		
However, it remains unclear if these infected mammals pose a significant risk for transmission to humans. When do people infected with SARS-CoV-2 infect others? Knowing when an infected person can spread SARS-CoV-2 is just as important as how the virus spreads (described above). WHO has recently published a scientific brief outlining what is known about when a person may be able to spread, based on the severity of their illness.(61)
		

What is the age-related transmission rate of the disease from individuals under 20 to those who are older, according to current scientific studies?		
An increase in the percentage of positive test results in older age groups is likely to result in more hospitalizations, severe illnesses, and deaths.¶ These findings corroborate regional patterns in the southern United States, where increased percent positivity among adults aged 20–39 years preceded increases among those aged ≥60 years (2); provide evidence that among young adults, those aged 18–24 years demonstrate the earliest increases in percent positivity; and underscore the importance of reducing transmission from younger populations to those at highest risk for severe illness or death. There is an urgent need to address transmission among young adult populations, especially given recent increases in COVID-19 incidence among young adults (3). These data also demonstrate the urgency of health care preparedness in hotspot counties,** which are likely to experience increases in COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations among older populations in the weeks after meeting hotspot criteria. Corresponding author: Alexandra M. Oster, aoster@cdc.gov.
		

What is the age-related transmission rate of the disease from individuals under 20 to those who are older, according to current scientific studies?		
It remains unclear why the magnitude of estimates from modelling studies differs from available empirical data. Transmission from infected people without symptoms is difficult to study. However, information can be gathered from detailed contact tracing efforts, as well as epidemiologic investigations among cases and contacts. Information from contact tracing efforts reported to WHO by Member States, available transmission studies and a recent pre-print systematic reviews suggests that individuals without symptoms are less likely to transmit the virus than those who develop symptoms.(10, 81, 84, 85) Four individual studies from Brunei, Guangzhou China, Taiwan China and the Republic of Korea found that between 0% and 2.2% of people with asymptomatic infection infected anyone else, compared to 0.8%-15.4% of people with symptoms.(10, 72, 86, 87) Many unanswered questions about transmission of SARS-CoV-2 remain, and research seeking to answer those questions is ongoing and is encouraged.

What Share of People Who Have Died of COVID-19 Are 65 and Older – and How Does It Vary By State? Since the early days of the pandemic, COVID-19 has taken its greatest toll among older adults in the US in terms of cases, hospitalizations and deaths. Months into the pandemic, older adults continue to be one of the populations most at risk of becoming seriously ill and dying from COVID-19. Adults 65 and older account for 16% of the US population but 80% of COVID-19 deaths in the US, somewhat higher than their share of deaths from all causes (75%) over the same period.
		

What is the age-related transmission rate of the disease from individuals under 20 to those who are older, according to current scientific studies?		
Many of the states that have reported a smaller share of adults 65 and older who have died of COVID-19 compared to the national average are in the South and the Sun Belt, including Alabama (76%), Tennessee (76%), Nevada (75%), Arizona (74%), Mississippi (74%), Arkansas (71%), New Mexico (71%), and Texas (70%). With the exception of Texas, these states have a population age distribution similar to the US average, which suggests that this finding is not a function of having a younger population. In these states, the pandemic is peaking later than in states that were hit earlier, which may contribute to a lag in deaths among older adults. States that have experienced a large percentage of deaths at long-term care facilities are also more likely to have a larger share of COVID-19 deaths in the oldest age cohort, those 85 and older (Figure 3).
		

What is the age-related transmission rate of the disease from individuals under 20 to those who are older, according to current scientific studies?		
Of the 41 states and District of Columbia included in this analysis, the share of people 65 and older who have died of COVID-19 varies considerably by state (Figure 1). The percent of COVID-19 deaths accounted for by people 65 and older is consistently high and ranges from a high of 94% in Idaho to a low of 70% in the District of Columbia. In most states, the share of adults 65 and older who have died due to COVID-19 is higher than their share of deaths from all causes (Figure 2). For example, in Idaho, a substantially higher share of people who have died of COVID-19 were 65 and older (94%) compared to deaths from all causes (76%).
		

What is the age-related transmission rate of the disease from individuals under 20 to those who are older, according to current scientific studies?		
The CDC recommends a COVID-19 vaccine for everyone age 6 months and older. The COVID-19 vaccine can lower the risk of death or serious illness caused by COVID-19. It lowers the risk for you and it lowers the risk that you may spread it to people around you. The COVID-19 vaccines available in the United States are: In general, people age 5 and older with typical immune systems can get any vaccine that is approved or authorized for their age.
		

What is the age-related transmission rate of the disease from individuals under 20 to those who are older, according to current scientific studies?		
Understanding whether increasing incidence in hotspot counties is predominantly occurring in specific age groups is important for identifying opportunities to prevent or reduce transmission. The percentage of positive SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test results (percent positivity) is an important indicator of community transmission. * CDC analyzed temporal trends in percent positivity by age group in COVID-19 hotspot counties before and after their identification as hotspots. Among 767 hotspot counties identified during June and July 2020, early increases in the percent positivity among persons aged ≤24 years were followed by several weeks of increasing percent positivity in persons aged ≥25 years.

Can you provide details or official documentation from John Cornyn's campaign or legislative proposals that specifically outline how his plan would guarantee that insurers must sell plans to patients with preexisting conditions and ensure coverage?		
The plan could, for example, provide the specific plan rules or guidelines governing the application of specific protocols, criteria, rate tables, fee schedules, etc. to claims like the claim at issue, or the specific checklist or cross-checking document that served to affirm that the plan rules or guidelines were appropriately applied to the claimant's claim. Plans are not required to disclose other claimants' individual records or information specific to the resolution of other claims in order to comply with this requirement. B-6: Do the regulation's limits on the use of pre-dispute arbitration extend to other actions that a participant or beneficiary might pursue with regard to a health care provider or other person or entity? No. The regulation is intended to regulate pre-dispute arbitration only with respect to group health and disability benefits provided under ERISA-covered plans.
		

Can you provide details or official documentation from John Cornyn's campaign or legislative proposals that specifically outline how his plan would guarantee that insurers must sell plans to patients with preexisting conditions and ensure coverage?		
Thus, in the absence of any plan requirement for prior approval, mere requests for advance information on the plan's possible coverage of items or services or advance approval of covered items or services do not constitute pre-service claims under the regulation. A-5: Is a plan required to treat all questions regarding benefits as claims for benefits under the plan? No. The regulation does not govern casual inquiries about benefits or the circumstances under which benefits might be paid under the terms of a plan. On the other hand, a group health plan that requires the submission of pre-service claims, such as requests for preauthorization, is not entirely free to ignore pre-service inquiries where there is a basis for concluding that the inquirer is attempting to file or further a claim for benefits, although not acting in compliance with the plan's claim filing procedures.
		

Can you provide details or official documentation from John Cornyn's campaign or legislative proposals that specifically outline how his plan would guarantee that insurers must sell plans to patients with preexisting conditions and ensure coverage?		
If, on the other hand, the individual files a claim for benefits in accordance with the plan's reasonable procedures, and that claim is denied because the individual is not eligible for coverage under the plan, the coverage determination is part of a claim and must be handled in accordance with the claims procedures of the plan and the requirements of the regulation. A-4: Does the regulation apply to a request for prior approval of a benefit or service when such prior approval is not required under the terms of the plan? No. If the plan does not require prior approval for the benefit or service with respect to which the approval is being requested, the request is not a claim for benefits (§ 2560.503-1(e)) governed by the regulation. The regulation defines pre-service claim by reference to the plan's requirements, not the claimant's decision to seek the medical care, nor the doctor's decision to provide care.
		

Can you provide details or official documentation from John Cornyn's campaign or legislative proposals that specifically outline how his plan would guarantee that insurers must sell plans to patients with preexisting conditions and ensure coverage?		
Inasmuch as a claimant's medical records relating to the benefit claim would be relevant documents, access to, and copies of, the claimant's medical records would have to be provided upon the claimant's request. The department notes, however, that if a plan has reason to believe that a claimant's medical records contain information that should be explained or disclosed by the physician (or other health professional) who developed the information, it would not be inconsistent with the regulation to refer the claimant to the physician (or other health professional) for such information prior to providing the requested documents directly to the claimant. However, if the physician to whom the claimant was referred failed to provide the requested information to the claimant in a reasonable period of time and without charge, the plan itself would be required to honor the claimant's request. D-12: Does the regulation require that a plan provide claimants with access to or copies of files of other claimants?
		

Can you provide details or official documentation from John Cornyn's campaign or legislative proposals that specifically outline how his plan would guarantee that insurers must sell plans to patients with preexisting conditions and ensure coverage?		
No. As indicated in question A-7, whether, and under what circumstances, specific practices permitted under a plan, such as the presentation of a prescription to a pharmacy, will constitute a claim for benefits governed by the claims procedure rules will depend on the terms of the plan. In this regard, a claim for benefits is defined in § 2560.503-1(e) to mean a request for a plan benefit or benefits made by a claimant in accordance with a plan's reasonable procedure for filing benefit claims. Accordingly, whether, and to what extent, the presentation of a prescription to a pharmacy which exercises no discretion on behalf of the plan will constitute a request for a plan benefit will be determined by reference to the plan's procedures for filing benefit claims. It is not uncommon for group health plans to have arrangements with preferred or network providers (e.g., doctors, physical therapists, pharmacies, optometrists) to provide medical care-related services or products at a predetermined cost to covered plan participants and with respect to which the providers exercise no discretion on behalf of the plan.
		

Can you provide details or official documentation from John Cornyn's campaign or legislative proposals that specifically outline how his plan would guarantee that insurers must sell plans to patients with preexisting conditions and ensure coverage?		
The one exception is where a claim involves urgent care. In such instances, a plan must, without regard to the plan's procedures for identifying authorized representatives, permit a health care professional with knowledge of the claimant's medical condition (e.g., a treating physician) to act as the authorized representative of the claimant. This exception is intended to enable a health care professional to pursue a claim on behalf of a claimant under circumstances where, for example, the claimant is unable to act on his or her own behalf. B-2: Does an assignment of benefits by a claimant to a health care provider constitute the designation of an authorized representative? No. An assignment of benefits by a claimant is generally limited to assignment of the claimant's right to receive a benefit payment under the terms of the plan.
		

Can you provide details or official documentation from John Cornyn's campaign or legislative proposals that specifically outline how his plan would guarantee that insurers must sell plans to patients with preexisting conditions and ensure coverage?		
See § 2560.503-1(h)(3)(iv) and (4). See question D-7. D-11: Does the regulation require that a group health plan provide a claimant with copies of the claimant's medical records relating to his or her benefit claim? Yes. The regulation requires a plan to provide claimants, upon request and free of charge, reasonable access to, and copies of, all documents, records, and other information relevant to a claimant's claim for benefits. Under the regulation, relevant documents include, among other things, documents or records relied upon in making a benefit determination and documents and records submitted in the course of making the benefit determination.

The regulation provides that, in order to allow claimants a reasonable opportunity for a full and fair review of their claim, a plan's claims procedures must provide for the identification of medical (or vocational) experts whose advice was obtained on behalf of the plan in connection with an adverse benefit determination, without regard to whether the advice was relied upon in making the determination. Under the rules, plans are not required to automatically provide, as part of a notice of an adverse benefit determination or otherwise, the identity of experts consulted during the claim determination process. Nor are plans required to disclose the name of experts in the absence of an adverse benefit determination.

The following timeline is based on interviews conducted with Kayla's parents, witnesses to her captivity and law enforcement and military officials, as well as an ABC News review of some U.S. government documents related to the case. Spring 2011: Popular uprisings against the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad steadily spread nationwide, eventually prompting a brutal backlash from the government. In the ensuing months and years, sporadic violence devolves into a gruesome, fractured civil war that claims the lives of countless civilians and forces many more from their homes. Thousands of refugees seek shelter in Syria's neighbor to the north, Turkey. At some point in 2011, the terror group formerly known as al Qaeda in Iraq slips into Syria, where it expands amid the chaos and in 2013 changes its name to the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, or ISIS.

147,"Because of a so-called trade war with China, America lost 300,000 manufacturing jobs.","What was the net change in the number of manufacturing jobs in the United States during the period associated with the trade war with China, and what factors contributed to this change?		
Of the total jobs lost due to the growing U.S.—China trade deficit, 2.8 million, or 75.4% of the total jobs lost, were in manufacturing. These losses were responsible for nearly all of the 2.9 million U.S. manufacturing jobs lost between December 2001 and December 2018. The growing trade deficit with China has reduced wages of those directly displaced by $37 billion through 2011 alone, and it is largely responsible for the loss of roughly $1,800 per worker per year, due to wage suppression, for all non-college-educated workers in the United States. These losses have been extremely costly for the workers and communities affected, as shown in this report.
		

What was the net change in the number of manufacturing jobs in the United States during the period associated with the trade war with China, and what factors contributed to this change?		
This slowdown in manufacturing job generation is also contributing to stagnating wages of typical workers and widening income inequality. U.S. jobs lost are spread throughout the country but are concentrated in manufacturing, including in industries in which the United States has traditionally held a competitive advantage. - The growth of the U.S. trade deficit with China between 2001 and 2018 was responsible for the loss of 3.7 million U.S. jobs, including 1.7 million jobs lost since 2008 (the first full year of the Great Recession, which technically began at the end of 2007). Three-fourths (75.4%) of the jobs lost between 2001 and 2018 were in manufacturing (2.8 million manufacturing jobs lost due to the growth in the trade deficit with China).
		

What was the net change in the number of manufacturing jobs in the United States during the period associated with the trade war with China, and what factors contributed to this change?		
There is no official Chinese data specifically on job losses as a result of the US-China trade war, but economic surveys carried out by two Chinese banks suggest a range of 1.2 to 1.9 million jobs were impacted by the trade war in the industrial sector. While the imposition of tariffs has had an impact on Chinese manufacturing, there are other reasons for job losses. ""It's possible to count job decline but the problem is - what's the cause?"", says Mary Lovely at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a US-based think tank. ""It's impossible to establish cause and effect,"" she says.
		

What was the net change in the number of manufacturing jobs in the United States during the period associated with the trade war with China, and what factors contributed to this change?		
Since China entered the World Trade Organization in 2001, the massive growth of trade between China and the United States has had a dramatic and negative effect on U.S. workers and the domestic economy. Specifically, a growing U.S. goods trade deficit with China has the United States piling up foreign debt, losing export capacity, and losing jobs, especially in the vital but under-siege manufacturing sector. Growth in the U.S. goods trade deficit with China between 2001 and 2013 eliminated or displaced 3.2 million U.S. jobs, 2.4 million (three-fourths) of which were in manufacturing. These lost manufacturing jobs account for about two-thirds of all U.S. manufacturing jobs lost or displaced between December, 2001 and December 2013.
		

What was the net change in the number of manufacturing jobs in the United States during the period associated with the trade war with China, and what factors contributed to this change?		
We can check the consistency of this finding with a different approach—looking at the total loss of manufacturing jobs and estimating the number of those job losses that are due to growing trade deficits with China. The United States lost 2.9 million manufacturing jobs between December 2001 and December 2018, a decline of 18.9% in total manufacturing employment (BLS 2019). Drawing from Pierce and Schott 2016 above, if 15.6 percentage points of this 18.9% decline can be attributed to the growth of the U.S. trade deficit with China, this implies that about 82.5% (or 2.4 million) of the manufacturing jobs lost in this period were lost due to the growing trade deficit with China. This estimate is very similar to this study’s estimated total manufacturing jobs displaced by the growing U.S.–China trade deficit (2.8 million net jobs displaced).

What was the net change in the number of manufacturing jobs in the United States during the period associated with the trade war with China, and what factors contributed to this change?		
As a result, China’s share of the overall U.S. goods trade deficit increased from 29.4 percent in 2008 to 37.3 percent in 2013.6 The growing trade deficit with China has led to U.S. job losses Each $1 billion in exports to China from the United States supports some American jobs. However, each $1 billion in imports from China displaces the American workers who would have been employed making these products in the United States. The net employment effect of trade depends on the changes in the trade balance. An improving trade balance can support job creation, but a growing trade deficit usually results in growing net U.S. job displacement.
		

What was the net change in the number of manufacturing jobs in the United States during the period associated with the trade war with China, and what factors contributed to this change?		
19. The term “major manufacturing sector” refers here to employment by three-digit NAICS manufacturing industries. The computer and electronic parts industry lost 1,340,600 of the 2,793,200 U.S. manufacturing jobs lost due to growing China trade deficits between 2001 and 2018 (Table 3), more than six times as many jobs as were lost as in apparel, the next largest of the hardest-hit three-digit manufacturing industries. Trade-related job losses in these industries, shown in Table 3, reflect both potential jobs displaced by the growth of imports (which represents domestic consumption that could have been supplied by domestically produced goods) and by the failure of exports to grow, resulting in large trade deficits in these products. 20. In earlier research, Autor, Dorn, and Hanson “conservatively estimate” that growing “Chinese import competition…imply a supply-shock driven net reduction in U.S. manufacturing employment of 548 thousand workers between 1990 and 2000, and a further reduction of 982 thousand workers between 2000 and 2007.”
		

What was the net change in the number of manufacturing jobs in the United States during the period associated with the trade war with China, and what factors contributed to this change?		
Between 2001 and 2011, growing exports to China supported 538,000 U.S. jobs, but growing imports displaced 3,280,200 jobs, for a net loss of 2.7 million U.S. jobs (Scott 2013, Table 5, 13). Thus, not only did workers lose wages moving from import-competing to exporting industries, but 2.7 million workers were displaced from jobs where they earned $1,021.66 per week on average. If they were lucky enough to find jobs, these 2.7 million workers were mostly pushed into jobs in nontraded industries paying an average of only $791.14 per week (a decline of 22.6%). In total, U.S. workers suffered a direct net wage loss of $37 billion per year (Scott 2013, 26, Table 9b) due to trade with China.
		

What was the net change in the number of manufacturing jobs in the United States during the period associated with the trade war with China, and what factors contributed to this change?		
If 15.6 percentage points of this 18.2 percent decline can be attributed the growth of the U.S. trade deficit with China, this implies that about 85.7 percent (or 2.5 million) of the manufacturing jobs lost in this period were lost due to the growing trade deficit with China. This estimate is even larger than this study’s estimated total manufacturing jobs displaced by the growing U.S.-China trade deficit (2.4 million net jobs displaced). Thus, two other recent academic studies have confirmed that the growing U.S.-China trade deficit is responsible for the displacement of more than 1 million U.S. manufacturing jobs since 1990, with most jobs lost since China entered the WTO in 2001.

DENVER — Several Democratic presidential candidates are running on a promise to ban fracking — and stepping on unstable political ground as they do so. An all-out prohibition on the controversial natural gas extraction process — backed by Sens. Kamala Harris, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren — has been well received by the liberal and climate-focused voters closely watching the primary. But the proposal also threatens to antagonize unions and voters in areas that depend on oil and gas for jobs. That opposition may be fiercest in some of the states Democrats care about most. Banning fracking could have a dramatic impact on the economy in Pennsylvania, a state Democrats consider a must-win in their pursuit of the White House.

HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) — The notion of banning fracking is dividing the Democrats running for president and increasingly dividing Democrats in the presidential battleground state of Pennsylvania, where fracking has vaulted it to the No. 2 natural gas producer behind Texas. The divide was clear, again, on Wednesday night’s debate stage in Las Vegas during questioning about climate change. Asked what he tells workers who would lose their job to a fracking ban, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, a longtime fracking opponent, said he tells them that scientists are predicting irreparable damage to the world without incredibly bold action within the next six or seven years. “This is a moral issue my friends,” Sanders said. “We have to take the responsibility of making sure that the planet we leave our children and grandchildren is a planet that is healthy and habitable.

Fracking is opposed by more Democrats in Pennsylvania’s Legislature, including state Rep. Danielle Friel Otten of Chester County. Otten supports Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren — who has said that she would fight for legislation to ban fracking nationwide — and said Democrats’ fear of banning fracking boils down to campaign cash. Campaign donations from building trades unions and the industry would flow to the other side, she said, while the public is more concerned about the impact of fracking to public health and the environment. “The reality is, the electorate as a whole, from every poll we’ve seen over the past two years, would vote to ban fracking,” Otten said in an interview Thursday.

Now some Democrats are openly hostile to the fossil fuel industry, with Sen. Bernie Sanders calling for criminal prosecution of some companies. The federal government can limit export licenses for oil and natural gas. However, a lot of the energy policy in the United States is governed at the state and local level, so a president can’t easily shape the agenda without local backing. At the local level, despite environmental and safety concerns, voters have been reluctant to restrict fracking. A ballot measure that would have severely restricted fracking in Colorado failed in 2018, despite Democrats winning the governorship and majorities in both state houses.

Fracking is a controversial drilling technology that, along with horizontal drilling, has created a major oil and gas boom. President Trump often brags about this on the campaign trail, though the boom started well before he became president. While the president largely dismisses the effects of climate change, Democrats have made addressing the issue a key element of their energy and environment platforms. Last September, Elizabeth Warren tweeted she would, ""ban fracking—everywhere."" Bernie Sanders talked about banning fracking during his 2016 run for president.

A companion bill was introduced in the Senate by Senators Bernie Sanders (VT-I) and Jeff Merkley (OR-D). The Ban Fracking Act would institute an immediate federal ban on all new federal permits for fracking-related infrastructure and a ban on fracking within 2,500 feet of homes and schools by 2021.

Even most environmental groups have advocated for regulation, not an all-out ban. But climate advocates have enjoyed growing influence in the primary, as the party’s base is increasingly focused on climate change and searching for immediate and meaningful policy solutions — even if the political path for those ideas is unclear. “To say that you would ban fracking is a very difficult position to take in some key states,” said Rick Ridder, a Democratic strategist who worked as Howard Dean’s 2004 presidential campaign manager and fought fracking in Colorado. “There’s an extremely important distinction between local control and banning something.”

It also uses the South African rand, the euro, and the Chinese yuan, alongside the dollar. However, because Zimbabwe has run a trade deficit for several years, importing more than it exports, the country is literally running out of paper money. In 2015, for example, it imported $5.5 billion in goods and only exported $2.5 billion. (The country’s economic problems are so bad it even had to sell off some of its wildlife.) That $3 billion trade deficit means the country’s supply of physical dollars continues to decrease. Zimbabweans can’t withdraw money from the bank because there isn’t enough of it—and banks have limited withdrawals at some ATMs. To combat the shortage, Zimbabwe’s central bank will design and circulate new two-, five-, 10-, and 20-dollar “bond notes” that will be worth the equivalent of the U.S. dollar, but won’t actually be certified American currency.

Among religious attenders, Democrats and those who lean toward the Democratic Party are more likely than Republicans and Republican leaners to say their congregation is closed, while Republicans are more likely than Democrats to say their congregation is open in a modified way. U.S. congregants generally are on board with implementing restrictions at their congregations. Nearly three-in-ten religious attenders (those who said in a 2019 survey that they attend services at least monthly or those who say in the current survey that they attended in person in the last month) say they think their congregation should be fully closed, and 57% think their congregation should be operating on a modified basis. Far fewer people think their congregations should be open and operating as normal. However, there are about twice as many religious attenders who think their congregation should be operating normally (13%) as there are who say their congregation currently is operating normally (6%). Mainline Protestants, members of the historically Black Protestant tradition and Hispanic Catholics are more likely than other Christian subgroups to say their congregation should be closed.
		

Has any official Democratic Party platform, policy proposal, or representative explicitly stated an intention to shut down U.S. churches permanently?		
Democrats who regularly attend religious services (54% of whom are Black or Hispanic) are more than twice as likely as Republican attenders (who are mostly white) to say their congregation should be closed (44% vs. 16%). By contrast, Republicans are more likely than Democrats to say their congregations should be open and operating normally (19% vs. 6%). A larger share of Republicans than Democrats also say their congregations should be open with modifications (64% vs. 48%). Taken together, these questions show that seven-in-ten U.S. religious attenders have preferences that align with the current operating status of their congregation, including 47% who attend congregations that are open with modifications and say that is the proper approach.

- Partisans hold diverging opinions about whether and how houses of worship should be reopening, if at all. Among religious attenders, more than six-in-ten Republicans and Republican leaners (64%) say their house of worship should be open to the public for in-person services with modifications in place, compared with 48% of Democrats who say this. In fact, Democrats and Democratic leaners are roughly divided between those who think their congregation should be closed entirely (44%) and those who think it should be open with modifications (48%). The survey also shows that Republicans who typically attended worship services before the pandemic are much more likely than Democrats in the same category to have recently gone to in-person services (42% vs. 19%).

People of faith depend on democratic norms for freedom of religion and often for protections of their identities. With safeguards under attack, the actions of the administration extend far beyond partisan differences, threatening many of the core institutions of the democratic system and leaving people of faith in an increasingly precarious position. One of the Trump administration’s first priorities, announced at the National Prayer Breakfast in February 2017, was to “destroy” the Johnson Amendment,89 despite polling indicating that the overwhelming majority of religious leaders want it to stay in place.90 The Johnson Amendment, adopted in 1954 without controversy, prohibits 501(c)(3) nonprofit organizations from endorsing political candidates. Many religious leaders naturally prefer this prohibition as a means of protecting their houses of worship from interference from partisan politics.91 Yet the president signed an executive order that purports to promote free speech and religious liberty on May 4, 2017, a predominantly symbolic effort with limited legal force, since overturning the part of the U.S. tax code92 involved in the Johnson Amendment would require an act of Congress.

Commentators have also drawn attention to the selective nature of the president’s concerns for the destruction of churches. In 2019, a man intentionally burned down three Black churches in Louisiana.86 Both Trump and Pence said nothing about the destruction of these churches; they did, however, make statements when Notre Dame, a church that is significant in Western European culture, was on fire in Paris.87 Other houses of worship have also received little to no attention from the administration; for example, there was no presidential tweet just two months prior to the incident at St. John’s Church, when a man set fire to a mosque in Missouri.88 The administration only vocalizes its alleged concerns for houses of worship when it benefits its policy agenda. The concerns of Black Christians, faithful protestors in support of Black Lives Matter, and religious minorities do not align with this agenda, which fails to grant all Americans equal protection under the law. The Trump administration has undermined democratic norms and violated ethics laws that many religious groups have championed.

At the same time, many state and local governments have carved out exemptions for religious institutions from pandemic-related restrictions. Among U.S. Christians, about three-quarters say churches should be subject to the same rules as other businesses. Evangelical Protestants express the most support for giving houses of worship more flexibility, but even in this group, a 62% majority says houses of worship should be held to the same standards as other businesses and organizations (see Chapter 1 for more details). And while Democrats and those who lean toward the Democratic Party are substantially more likely than Republicans and Republican leaners to say houses of worship should be required to follow the same social distancing rules as other organizations, a two-thirds majority of Republicans also express this view.

And with a presidential election looming, four-in-ten say they have heard from clergy about the importance of voting, protesting or other forms of political engagement. Houses of worship also continue to express their views on abortion. About one-third of Americans who have watched or attended services in the last month say they heard sermons that have expressed opposition to abortion (35%), while one-in-ten (11%) heard support for legal abortion. Judging by their answers to the survey, Democrats and Republicans are not hearing all of the same messages at their congregations. For instance, Democrats and those who lean Democratic are substantially more likely than Republicans and adults who lean toward the GOP to say they have heard sermons that expressed support for the recent Black Lives Matter protests (59% vs. 29%) and the importance of voting (52% vs. 33%).

Despite this, President Trump started claiming that “we got rid” of the Johnson Amendment.93 Meanwhile, the administration has further eroded the separation of church and state by pushing for more taxpayer funding for private religious schools94 and lifting important restrictions on religious organizations. One notable example was the issuance of not one, but nine, new regulations in January and February 2020 that undermine the separation of church and state. The White House alleged that the intent of this effort was to ensure that “religious organizations can compete on a level playing field for funding,”95 but it in fact allows religious organizations competing for federal funds to opt out of requirements other social service organizations are obligated to follow.96

“Obamacare was a disaster, and the American people remember it well. And President Trump and I have a plan to improve health care and protect the existing conditions for every American,” Pence countered. While Trump has long insisted that he and the GOP will protect people with pre-existing conditions from losing their health insurance, he has pursued legislation, litigation and executive actions to dismantle those protections under the Affordable Care Act. A Republican bill backed by Trump included ACA state waivers that would allow insurers to charge higher prices to people with pre-existing conditions, potentially pricing them out of the market. It passed the House and died in the Senate in 2017. Trump has also used executive actions to expand the use of short-term insurance plans that aren't required to cover pre-existing conditions.

154,COVID-19 had caused zero deaths in people under 20.,"Has there been any reported case of a COVID-19 fatality among individuals under the age of 20 in official health records or studies?		
2019-nCoV: preliminary estimates of the confirmed-case-fatality-ratio and infection-fatality-ratio, and initial pandemic risk assessment. It is clear from the data that have emerged from China that case fatality ratio increases substantially with age. Our results suggest a very low fatality ratio in those under the age of 20 years. As there are very few cases in this age group, it remains unclear whether this reflects a low risk of death or a difference in susceptibility, although early results indicate young people are not at lower risk of infection than adults. 28Serological testing in this age group will be crucial in the coming weeks to understand the significance of this age group in driving population transmission.
		

Has there been any reported case of a COVID-19 fatality among individuals under the age of 20 in official health records or studies?		
Estimates of case fatality ratio from international cases stratified by age were consistent with those from China (parametric estimate 1·4% [0·4–3·5] in those aged <60 years [n=360] and 4·5% [1·8–11·1] in those aged ≥60 years [n=151]). Our estimated overall infection fatality ratio for China was 0·66% (0·39–1·33), with an increasing profile with age. Similarly, estimates of the proportion of infected individuals likely to be hospitalised increased with age up to a maximum of 18·4% (11·0–37·6) in those aged 80 years or older. These early estimates give an indication of the fatality ratio across the spectrum of COVID-19 disease and show a strong age gradient in risk of death.
		

Has there been any reported case of a COVID-19 fatality among individuals under the age of 20 in official health records or studies?		
Since February 12, 4,226 COVID-19 cases were reported in the United States; 31% of cases, 45% of hospitalizations, 53% of ICU admissions, and 80% of deaths occurred among adults aged ≥65 years with the highest percentage of severe outcomes among persons aged ≥85 years. These findings are similar to data from China, which indicated >80% of deaths occurred among persons aged ≥60 years (3). These preliminary data also demonstrate that severe illness leading to hospitalization, including ICU admission and death, can occur in adults of any age with COVID-19. In contrast, persons aged ≤19 years appear to have milder COVID-19 illness, with almost no hospitalizations or deaths reported to date in the United States in this age group.

Note that the Crude Mortality Rate will continue to increase as more infections and deaths occur (see notes under the paragraph ""Herd Immunity"" below for details). See also: Death Rate by Age and Sex of COVID-19 patients When analyzing the breakdown of deaths by age and condition [source], we can observe how, out of 15,230 confirmed deaths in New York City up to May 12, only 690 (4.5% of all deaths) occurred in patients under the age of 65 who did not have an underlying medical condition (or for which it is unknown whether they had or did not have an underlying condition). Underlying illnesses include Diabetes, Lung Disease, Cancer, Immunodeficiency, Heart Disease, Hypertension, Asthma, Kidney Disease, GI/Liver Disease, and Obesity [source]
		

Has there been any reported case of a COVID-19 fatality among individuals under the age of 20 in official health records or studies?		
This first preliminary description of outcomes among patients with COVID-19 in the United States indicates that fatality was highest in persons aged ≥85, ranging from 10% to 27%, followed by 3% to 11% among persons aged 65–84 years, 1% to 3% among persons aged 55-64 years, <1% among persons aged 20–54 years, and no fatalities among persons aged ≤19 years. What are the implications for public health practice? COVID-19 can result in severe disease, including hospitalization, admission to an intensive care unit, and death, especially among older adults. Everyone can take actions, such as social distancing, to help slow the spread of COVID-19 and protect older adults from severe illness.

It reported that 0.04% of 10-19 year olds would probably require hospital care—as would 1.0% of people in their 20s, 3.4% of people aged 30-39, 4.3% aged 40-49, 8.2% aged 50-59, 11.8% in their 60s, 16.6% in their 70s, and 18.4% of those over 80. Neil Ferguson, lead researcher from Imperial College London who carries out modelling for the UK government’s covid-19 response, said, “As the UK epidemic unfolds, more data are becoming available, and at the moment the proportion of people in each age group most likely to require hospitalisation and [the proportion] most likely to die from infection are consistent with the estimates in this study.” For the case fatality rate the team analysed 70 117 laboratory confirmed and clinically diagnosed cases in mainland China, along with 689 positive cases among people evacuated from Wuhan on repatriation flights. Using the number of confirmed cases and deaths, the researchers reported the “crude case fatality ratio” as 3.67% (95% confidence interval 3.56% to 3.80%).

Globally, approximately 170,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) have been reported, including an estimated 7,000 deaths in approximately 150 countries (1). On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic (2). Data from China have indicated that older adults, particularly those with serious underlying health conditions, are at higher risk for severe COVID-19–associated illness and death than are younger persons (3). Although the majority of reported COVID-19 cases in China were mild (81%), approximately 80% of deaths occurred among adults aged ≥60 years; only one (0.1%) death occurred in a person aged ≤19 years (3). In this report, COVID-19 cases in the United States that occurred during February 12–March 16, 2020 and severity of disease (hospitalization, admission to intensive care unit [ICU], and death) were analyzed by age group.

We also assumed perfect case ascertainment outside of Wuhan in the age group with the most cases relative to their population size (50–59-year-olds); however, if many cases were missed, the case fatality ratio and infection fatality ratio estimates might be lower. In the absence of random population surveys of infection prevalence, our adjustment from case fatality ratio to infection fatality ratio relied on repatriation flight data, which was not age specific. The reported proportion of infected individuals who were asymptomatic on the Diamond Princess did not vary considerably by age, supporting this approach, but future larger representative population prevalence surveys and seroprevalence surveys will inform such estimates further.

In August 2016, just months before the presidential election, an FBI supervisor who oversaw the burgeoning counterintelligence investigation attended a briefing that intelligence officials were giving to the Trump campaign, in part so that the FBI supervisor could observe Michael Flynn, a former general who had taken on a leading national security role in the campaign. The agent later wrote a memo recording his observations at the meeting of Flynn, who at the time had fallen under scrutiny of FBI investigators. Horowitz found that the interaction didn’t violate Justice Department regulations, but said that it had the potential to undermine the trust in future such campaign briefings. Overall, Horowitz determined that the President’s campaign was not improperly “spied” on, but the report does document multiple interactions between members of the Trump campaign and FBI sources.

The report concluded that officials at the FBI had enough information to properly launch the investigation in 2016, and dispel the claim that US intelligence agencies tried to plant spies in the Trump campaign. Trump has boosted that narrative without evidence for months and popularized the term “Spy-gate.” The conspiracy is a frequent topic in the conservative media and often revolves around Joseph Mifsud, a secretive Maltese professor who played a role in the origins of the FBI’s counterintelligence investigation. Mifsud had interactions with George Papadopoulos, a Trump campaign adviser who pleaded guilty in 2017 to making false statements to the FBI. US intelligence agencies were said to have told Horowitz that Misfud was not an asset for Western intelligence agencies, which is a claim spread by Papadopoulos and other conservative figures.

It would have taken an expert to realize that was the case with Trump’s treatment.

These molecules are manufactured in cells from a hamster’s ovary, so-called “CHO” cells, according to the company—not in human cells. But cells originally derived from a fetus were used in another way. According to Regeneron, laboratory tests used to assess the potency of its antibodies employed a standardized supply of cells called HEK 293T, whose origin was kidney tissue from an abortion in the Netherlands in the 1970s.

The President's physician, Sean Conley, said in a statement that Mr Trump ""remains fatigued but in good spirits"" after receiving an intravenous dose of Regeneron Pharmaceuticals' dual antibody. Regeneron's cocktail, REGN-COV2, is part of a class of experimental COVID-19 treatments known as monoclonal antibodies. Antibodies are proteins made by the body's immune system that recognise, bind and neutralise an invading virus. REGN-COV2 — which contains an antibody made by Regeneron and a second isolated from humans who recovered from COVID-19 — is designed so that its two antibodies bind to the coronavirus' spike protein, limiting the ability of viruses to escape.

It was created using genetically engineered mice the company developed that have immune systems much like those of humans, and which have been used to develop a number of marketed medicines for disorders like high cholesterol and debilitating skin diseases. The selected antibodies were shown in lab studies to tightly bind the protein the coronavirus uses to infect cells. In the results released Tuesday from a 275-person study, the Regeneron treatment seemed to lead levels of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in nasal swabs taken from patients to decrease more quickly than they did in those patients who received a placebo.

Hindering Covid-19 Research by Appointing Opponents of Fetal Tissue Research to Advisory Panel In the midst of the pandemic, the Trump administration convened a bioethics advisory committee stacked with individuals who oppose fetal tissue research, which, among other things, is used to develop vaccines and treatments for Covid-19. (In fact, the antibody President Trump received to treat Covid-19 was developed using a cell line derived from fetal tissue.) Violating legal requirements for balance in viewpoints, the committee recommended that 13 of 14 funding applications for scientific research projects involving the tissue be rejected, despite the fact that scientific reviewers convened by the National Institutes of Health had already recommended that the projects be funded and they had met the legal requirements for ethical use of such tissue.

The gold standard for vetting any medical treatment is a clinical trial in which patients are randomly assigned a treatment or an ostensibly ineffective placebo. Regeneron is running the early stages of those trials for REGN-COV2. However, full results haven’t been published—leaving some medical experts leery of using it on anyone, let alone a world leader. Trump’s doctors are “just so worried about him, that even if it’s really harmful or even if it does nothing, they might as well do it,” Faust adds. During a September 29 briefing to investors and the media, Regeneron announced preliminary results from the first 275 patients in an ongoing clinical trial.

Republicans stood by their party’s leader, who has frequently tested the bounds of civic norms. Trump called the whole affair a “witch hunt,” a “hoax” and a “sham,” and sometimes all three.

By obscuring QAnon’s role in creating and spreading these conspiracy theories, it allows the underlying beliefs to gain traction with a wider audience. The QAnon movement began as an American conspiracy theory rooted in the belief that Trump was in an ongoing battle against a nefarious “Deep State” within the United States government. However, just as the movement has found inroads with social media influencers, it is also making efforts to cross language barriers. Jeff Yates, a Canadian journalist in predominantly French-speaking Montreal, Quebec, tweeted on September 18 that Radio-Quebec, a far-right YouTuber whose real name is Alexis Cossette-Trudel, removed all his videos related to QAnon at “the request of Q.” Trudel’s YouTube channel, which has over 100,000 subscribers, includes multiple videos espousing COVID-19 conspiracy theories.

The report indicated that Mr. Navalny was exposed to a toxic chemical acting as a cholinesterase inhibitor. Biomarkers found in Mr. Navalny’s system showed that the agent used against him, while not listed in the CWC Annex, held structural characteristics similar to those of the Novichok agents in schedules 1.A.14 and 1.A.15. The Executive council held its ninety-fifth session October 6-9 to address the implementation of the CWC. The session addressed the updates to the OPCW fact-finding mission in Syria, among other issues.

2. Recalls that the use of chemical weapons under any circumstances constitutes a reprehensible crime under international law, in particular under the Chemical Weapons Convention; 3. Underlines that the attempted assassination of Alexei Navalny was part of a systemic effort to silence him and other dissident voices, and to deter him and those voices from further exposing serious corruption in the regime and deter political opposition in the country in general, in particular with a view to influencing Russia’s local and regional by-elections of 11-13 September; 4. Reiterates that the case of Alexei Navalny is one element of a wider Russian policy focusing on oppressive internal policies and aggressive actions worldwide, spreading instability and chaos, restabilising its sphere of influence and dominance, and undermining the rules-based international order; 5. Asks for the immediate launch of an international investigation (with the involvement of the EU, the UN, the Council of Europe, their allies and the OPCW) and emphasises its resolve to contribute to such an investigation; calls on the OPCW to establish a detailed investigation into breaches of Russia’s international commitments in the area of chemical weapons; calls on the Russian authorities to fully cooperate with the OPCW to ensure an impartial international investigation and to hold to account those responsible for the crime committed against Alexei Navalny;
		

What specific evidence or documentation has been presented by the OPCW or any other credible source to support the claim of a planned conspiracy scenario in the Navalny case?		
On 21 December, the OPCW published correspondence between the OPCW Technical Secretariat and the Russian Federation. In this correspondence, the Russian Federation requested that the Technical Secretariat dispatch a team of experts to Russia to further examine the Alexei Navalny poisoning. The Technical Secretariat replied that a team of experts could be dispatched, as long as necessary legal requirements were met and Mr. Navalny’s consent was obtained. On 8 January, the OPCW announced they had acquired information regarding alleged use of chemical weapons in Aleppo, Syria on 24 November 2018.
		

What specific evidence or documentation has been presented by the OPCW or any other credible source to support the claim of a planned conspiracy scenario in the Navalny case?		
Apart from a specialized laboratory in Germany, two independent facilities in France and Sweden tested Navalny’s samples and reported the presence of Novichok, a class of military grade nerve agents that were developed by the Soviet Union. Russia has denied any involvement in Navalny’s illness and disputed that he was poisoned. Instead, Russian narratives of what happened to Russian President Vladimir Putin’s fiercest critic have included self-poisoning, metabolic disorder, alcohol poisoning and a drug overdose. Most recently, Russian presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia has “intelligence” that Navalny was working with the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency. (In response, Navalny said the claim is false and that he will sue for defamation.)
		

What specific evidence or documentation has been presented by the OPCW or any other credible source to support the claim of a planned conspiracy scenario in the Navalny case?		
Novichok is categorized as a chemical weapon of mass destruction and is prohibited by the Organization for Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW). As such, Germany views the Navalny case as a violation of “international law prohibiting the use of chemical weapons” and thus “sees no reason” for handing evidence over to Russia, the German government’s deputy spokeswoman Martina Fietz has said. Germany shared samples and data from the Navalny case with the OPCW, which conducts its own lab tests. ""I don't think it is appropriate to link this business-operated project with the Navalny question,"" Merkel said, responding to suggestions that Navalny’s case could be an “opportunity” for her to shift her views.
		

What specific evidence or documentation has been presented by the OPCW or any other credible source to support the claim of a planned conspiracy scenario in the Navalny case?		
The OPCW is a respected international organisation, which is working to rid the world of chemical weapons. Hostile action against it demonstrates complete disregard for its vital mission. This disruption happened in April. Around that time, the OPCW was working to independently verify the UK’s analysis of the chemical used in the poisoning of the Skripals in Salisbury. As we know, the OPCW confirmed the UK’s analysis that a Novichok nerve agent was used in the Salisbury attack – which we now know for certain was carried out by serving GRU officers.
		

What specific evidence or documentation has been presented by the OPCW or any other credible source to support the claim of a planned conspiracy scenario in the Navalny case?		
Meanwhile, OPCW Director-General Ahmet Üzümcü has tasked the organization’s Scientific Advisory Board to review the relevant literature and to clarify the definition of parent compounds and other chemicals that fall under the “novichok” nomenclature. While this will prove valuable for verification purposes, it will also provide a further basis for disagreements at OPCW meetings. Russia (with varying support of other states) can use any statement or document to support posing further reductionist questions — some of which are constructive — to challenge the validity of OPCW verification findings. In other words, any given report can be employed so as to achieve closure of an investigation or to promote open-ended discussion.

– having regard to the statement from the Director-General of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) of 3 September 2020 on allegations of chemical weapons use against Alexei Navalny, underlining that ‘under the Chemical Weapons Convention, any poisoning of an individual through the use of a nerve agent is considered a use of chemical weapons’, – having regard to Article 5 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and Article 7 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, both of which provide that no one is to be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, and to which the Russian Federation is a party, – having regard to the Declaration on the Right and Responsibility of Individuals, Groups and Organs of Society to Promote and Protect Universally Recognized Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms adopted by the UN General Assembly on 9 December 1998, – having regard to Rule 132(2) and (4) of its Rules of Procedure,
		

What specific evidence or documentation has been presented by the OPCW or any other credible source to support the claim of a planned conspiracy scenario in the Navalny case?		
E. whereas Alexei Navalny expressed his strong support for the protesters in Khabarovsk and Belarus and regarded the changes in Belarus as inspiration for the people of Russia; F. whereas political assassinations and poisonings in Russia are systemic instruments of the regime deliberately targeting the opposition; whereas this is further exacerbated by the unwillingness of the authorities to thoroughly investigate the politically motivated or attempted murders of Anna Politkovskaya, Boris Nemtsov, Sergei Protazanov, Vladimir Kara-Murza and others; whereas representatives of the opposition are systematically subjected to verbal attacks, ad hominem campaigns and dehumanisation by the government or pro-government media; G. whereas this most recent assassination attempt is just the latest example of very serious backsliding on the protection of human rights and respect for commonly agreed democratic principles and the rule of law in the Russian Federation; H. whereas the ongoing repression of social dissent is reinforced by the impunity of police and security forces as well as the unwillingness of the courts to prosecute the real perpetrators of those crimes, which not only go unpunished but are even rewarded by the Kremlin;

False posts about Sen. Chuck Schumer originated as satire CLAIM: Democratic Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer had an “affair” in 1977 with his daughter’s best friend from high school when the girl was 16. AP’S ASSESSMENT: False. Versions of this baseless story have been circulating since a satire site first made up the rumor in late 2017. THE FACTS: The satire site America’s Last Line of Defense invented a story in December 2017 about Schumer’s daughter “Lisa” disclosing a sex scandal involving her father.

Ever since the satire site published its false story about Schumer, versions of the story have continued to circulate on social media and right-wing websites as if the story was true. The most recent version, a Facebook post with tens of thousands of views, shows a photo of Schumer and suggests “the alleged affair” happened in 1977 with “his daughter’s best friend from high school” and that Schumer’s “own wife, Kaitlyn, paid the girl’s mother nearly $2 million to go away.” The post said Schumer paid for the girl to have two abortions, and that the girl later killed herself. All details in the post are false, but the timeline is particularly implausible since neither of Schumer’s two daughters had been born by 1977.
		

Is there any credible and verified source or documentation that confirms or denies an affair between Chuck Schumer and his daughter's high school best friend in 1977?		
Schumer does not have a daughter named Lisa and the details described in the story are not true. The satire website is no longer online, but an internet archive shows in 2018 the “about” section read, “America’s Last Line of Defense is a whimsical playland of conservative satire” and “Everything on this website is fiction.” At the time the satire piece ran, Alabama voters were days away from voting in a special Senate election. Republican candidate Roy Moore was under fire after allegations surfaced that he had engaged in sexual misconduct with underage girls in the late 1970s.

The 2018 Poverty and Shared Prosperity Report shows how poverty is changing and introduces improved ways to monitor our progress toward ending it. The landscape of extreme poverty is now split in two. While most of the world has seen extreme poverty fall to below 3 percent of the population, Sub-Saharan Africa is experiencing extreme poverty rates affecting more than 40 percent of people. The lamentable distinction of being home to the most people living in extreme poverty has shifted, or will soon shift, from India to Nigeria, symbolizing the increased concentration of poverty in Africa. Until recently, progress toward the target of reducing extreme poverty to 3 percent by 2030 had been steady: Between 1990 and 2013, extreme poverty declined on average by a percentage point a year.

In both countries, the majority of people think that the share of people living in extreme poverty has increased. Two thirds in the US even think the share in extreme poverty has ‘almost doubled.’ When we are ignorant about the basic facts about global development it is not surprising that we have a negative view of our times and that few have the hope that the world can get better. The only way to tell a history of everyone is to use statistics. Only then can we hope to get an overview of the lives of the 22 billion people that lived in the last 200 years. The developments that these statistics reveal transform our global living conditions — slowly but steadily.

In rich countries, a person is considered poor when she or he lives on less than $30 per day; if we rely on this poverty definition, then we find that 85% of the world lives in poverty.1 Much more progress is needed.

In 1820, only a small elite enjoyed higher standards of living, while the vast majority of people lived in conditions that we call extreme poverty today. Since then, the share of extremely poor people fell continuously. More and more world regions industrialized and achieved economic growth which made it possible to lift more people out of poverty: In 1950 about half the world were living in extreme poverty; in 1990, it was still more than a third. By 2019 the share of the world population in extreme poverty has fallen below 10%. The world is also making progress against poverty relative to higher poverty lines, as this visualization shows.

This count is almost three times more than the global count of people living on less than $1.90 per day (estimated at approximately 731 million in 2015). The charts above display the change over time in both the count and the rate of societal poverty, as measured by the SPL; and similarly displays the count and rate of absolute extreme poverty as measured by the IPL of $1.90 per day. The first striking aspect is that while the total count of people living in extreme poverty has declined rapidly, the number of people who are identified as societally poor has largely stayed the same over the last 35 years. In contrast, the percentage of the global population that are societally poor has fallen steadily since 1990, but still at a much slower rate than the decline of extreme poverty.

However, not all countries have experienced this progress, and the progress is quickly decelerating. It now takes more than two years to reduce poverty by a percentage point, according to the latest estimates. What this means is that if countries grow in line with regional historical rates, extreme poverty will fall no lower than around 6 percent globally by 2030, with average poverty rates above 25 percent in Sub-Saharan Africa. Reaching the 3 percent target would require all countries to grow at an unprecedented 8 percent rate annually. And even then, extreme poverty in Sub-Saharan Africa would remain in double digits, while the rest of the world would be close to zero.

President Obama was also notable in the amount of commutations granted at once. In 2016, President Obama granted 583 commutations and six pardons. In one of the last weeks of his presidency, President Obama granted clemency to 273 federal inmates. Only a few days later, President Obama commuted 330 sentences of federal inmates in one day. This set a record. Over 80% of President Obama’s commutations were granted in his last six months as president. Another record President Obama set was the number of denials of clemency. It makes sense, of course, since he received such an enormous amount of petitions for clemency.
		

How many acts of clemency (pardons and commutations) were granted by President Obama during his administration?		
Obama granted clemency to more than 1,900 people while in office, commuting the sentences of people imprisoned or pardoning them. Although he only granted 5% of requests, he received more than 36,000 clemency requests. A Pew Research Center analysis found that Obama granted clemency to more people convicted of federal crimes than any president in 64 years. The analysis also notes the administration asked for requests through its Clemency Initiative, launched in 2014.

How many acts of clemency (pardons and commutations) were granted by President Obama during his administration?		
In one more end-of-presidency act of clemency aimed at prisoners serving long sentences for drug-related offenses, President Obama announced Thursday that he is commuting the sentences of 330 prisoners. He has granted clemency to more people than any president since Harry S. Truman,1 and Thursday’s announcement was typical of how Obama’s approach to clemency has differed from that of his predecessors: Obama’s clemency is almost always given by freeing people from prison with commuted sentences, not pardoning people after their release. On Tuesday, with less than a week left in office, Obama granted clemency to 273 federal inmates, including Chelsea Manning, the army intelligence analyst who was convicted in 2013 of disclosing sensitive information to WikiLeaks. Manning’s commutation was one of 209 that Obama made Tuesday; with the 330 from Thursday, his total number of commutations is now 1,715, more than any other president in history, according to the White House.

How many acts of clemency (pardons and commutations) were granted by President Obama during his administration?		
In the end, President Obama’s clemency initiative resulted in 1,715  commutations of sentence.115 While President Obama’s grants were historically  significant, his efforts largely failed if the goal was to (as he put it) “address  particularly unjust sentences in individual cases” because so many deserving 
		

How many acts of clemency (pardons and commutations) were granted by President Obama during his administration?		
President Obama left a legacy in regards to his exercise of executive clemency. From the start of his term, he stated that mercy and clemency were at the forefront of his presidency. President Obama used all of the clemency powers available to him: commutations of sentences, pardons, remission of fines, and reprieves. President Obama granted more clemency than any other President in 64 years with considerable obama clemency statistics. However, he also received the most requests for clemency than any other president. His administration set up an initiative in 2014 to shorten prison terms for nonviolent federal inmates convicted of drug crimes, which led to the increase in clemency petitions.
		

How many acts of clemency (pardons and commutations) were granted by President Obama during his administration?		
President obama's clemency statistics are staggering in numbers. Obama granted clemency to 1,927 individuals. While President Obama left an executive clemency legacy, it is important to look at the breakdown of this legacy compared to former presidents. However, when you break down the numbers, President Obama is on the lower percentage end of total clemency petitions granted. According to Pew Research, President Obama only granted 5% of the clemency requests he received. Compare this to earlier presidents like President Kennedy who granted 33%, President Truman who granted 41%, and President Franklin Roosevelt who granted 28%.

169,A Congressman Just Introduced A Bill To Remove Nancy Pelosi From The House.,"Has a Congressman recently introduced a bill specifically aimed at removing Nancy Pelosi from the House of Representatives, and if so, what are the details of this bill?		
In response, Speaker Nancy Pelosi in June called for removing statues of Confederates from the National Statuary Hall Collection. Last month, Pelosi also directed the removal of four portraits in the Capitol of former speakers who served in the Confederacy: Robert Hunter of Virginia, Howell Cobb of Georgia, James Orr of South Carolina and Charles Crisp of Georgia. The House’s $4.2 billion Legislative Branch appropriations bill overlaps with Hoyer’s measure — it would remove 14 statues and two busts, including Taney’s. Hoyer invoked his late House colleague, Georgia Democrat John Lewis, a civil rights icon, who died Friday.
		

Has a Congressman recently introduced a bill specifically aimed at removing Nancy Pelosi from the House of Representatives, and if so, what are the details of this bill?		
Pelosi had originally refused to allow the House vote on the infrastructure bill until after Senate passage of Biden’s ambitious plan for expanding the country’s social safety net and combating climate change. In August 2022 Pelosi became the highest-ranking elected U.S. official to visit Taiwan in some 25 years. The controversial visit by Pelosi, a longtime critic of the Chinese government, heightened tensions between the U.S. and China, which considers the self-ruling island to be its territory and viewed the presence of a U.S. official of the speaker’s stature as provocatively enhancing the international standing of Taiwan’s government.
		

Has a Congressman recently introduced a bill specifically aimed at removing Nancy Pelosi from the House of Representatives, and if so, what are the details of this bill?		
Now she wants to prevent a Senate trial, perhaps indefinitely. But the Constitution gives the Senate sole power to adjudicate articles of impeachment, not the House. If Speaker Pelosi is afraid to try her case, the articles should be dismissed for failure to prosecute and Congress should get back to doing the people’s business."" Senator Rick Scott said, ""Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer are making a mockery of our government. Democrats have wanted to impeach Donald Trump since he came down that escalator four years ago. They just hate Trump. But Chairman Schiff did a great job showing the American people that the President did nothing wrong and that this is just an effort to undo the 2016 election.

Pelosi told the White House to rein in Emanuel and get him to stop pestering her members about his “eensy weensy bill.” At a meeting in the Oval Office, Pelosi confronted the subject directly. “Mr. President, I know there are some on your staff who want to take the namby-pamby approach,” she said. “That’s unacceptable.” Obama took her side. They were going to go for it. If the House passed the bill the Senate had already passed, Obama could sign it into law. Pelosi had previously declared the Senate bill “a nonstarter.”

The historic bill extended health care to some 30 million previously uninsured Americans and prohibited insurers from denying coverage to those with preexisting conditions. Pelosi’s popularity declined, however, as the economy continued to struggle and as opposition to legislation she had championed—notably health care reform and the stimulus package—increased. In the lead-up to the 2010 midterm elections, she became a target of Republican attacks and a rallying point for Tea Partiers, who were keen to turn the elections into a referendum on the Democratic agenda. The Democrats fared poorly in the November elections and lost control of the House. Despite calls for new party leadership, Pelosi was elected to serve as minority leader in the next Congress.
		

Has a Congressman recently introduced a bill specifically aimed at removing Nancy Pelosi from the House of Representatives, and if so, what are the details of this bill?		
After the majority of Senate Republicans, led by Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, blocked the formation of a bipartisan independent commission to investigate the Capitol attack, Pelosi oversaw the formation of the House’s Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the United States Capitol. When Pelosi refused to seat two of Republican House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy’s five nominees for the committee—Representatives Jim Banks and Jim Jordan—because, she argued, they were too closely involved with Trump to participate credibly, McCarthy withdrew all five nominations. In their places Pelosi appointed Republicans Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger, who joined the seven Democrats on the committee, which began its investigation in July 2021. In the meantime, Pelosi shepherded House passage of a massive bill aimed at restoring and improving U.S. infrastructure despite the Senate’s failure to approve the Build Back Better Act.

Senator Hawley said, ""Speaker Pelosi started this bogus impeachment by claiming President Trump was an urgent ‘threat to democracy’ who had to be removed now.

On January 6, 2021, his supporters stormed the Capitol as Congress was in the process of certifying Biden’s victory. Many accused Trump of encouraging the attack, and Pelosi demanded his removal from office. To that end, she oversaw passage of a House resolution that called on Vice Pres. Mike Pence to invoke the Twenty-fifth Amendment. After he refused, Pelosi launched impeachment proceedings, charging Trump with “incitement of insurrection.” The House voted to impeach Trump on January 13, 2021, a week before the end of his term. However, the Senate subsequently acquitted him.

This is AI generated summarization, which may have errors. For context, always refer to the full article. (Editor’s note: An earlier version of the story rated the claim as PARTLY FALSE, since one source said that people with certain underlying conditions are at risk of suffering from hypoxia or hypercapnia if they use a mask for prolonged hours. Upon further review, it was found that more substantial evidence was needed to support this claim. The earlier version of this story also failed to clarify that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s advice on who should not wear face masks is not necessarily related to risks of hypoxia and hypercapnia.

02/7Can face masks affect your oxygen levels? Here is what the WHO says Amidst growing concern in public about the impact of medical masks on oxygen intake and the build-up of carbon dioxide, the World Health Organization has maintained that the prolonged use of medical masks (also known as surgical masks) do not cause oxygen deficiency or Carbon dioxide intoxication. Infact, echoing the sentiments of the global health agency, Dr Mehmet Oz, who is a cardiothoracic surgeon in Columbia had put out a video “quashing” rumours that face masks affect the oxygen levels. In the video, Dr Oz is seen measuring his oxygen saturation both before and after wearing a surgical mask and an N-95 respirator using a pulse oximeter.
		

Does current scientific evidence support the claim that wearing face masks leads to oxygen deprivation in individuals?		
In fact, healthcare workers often wear masks for long hours in the hospital. There is no evidence that surgical masks or cloth masks cause significant deficiency of oxygen. This information has been primarily circulating on social media among individuals or communities resistant to mask-wearing in general. While masks are restrictive and can feel like they impede air flow, properly designed masks do allow air flow by design, and the feeling of inconvenience or minor discomfort does not equate to health risks such as a lack of oxygen. Low oxygen levels in the blood (hypoxemia) can cause issues in the body to not receive enough oxygen (hypoxia), but both are unlikely to happen as a result of wearing a properly designed mask or face covering.

173,Carbon dioxide intoxication is caused by wearing face masks.,"Does wearing a face mask, including those designed to be used during the COVID-19 pandemic, cause carbon dioxide intoxication in healthy individuals when used properly?		
You may have heard that wearing a mask will cause carbon dioxide poisoning. The mask might hold a very small amount of carbon dioxide, but the carbon dioxide can pass through the holes on the sides and even the pores of the material itself. Humans inhale trace amounts of carbon dioxide all day long and suffer no issues. Some carbon dioxide is a good thing and helps regulate your blood levels. An extremely high level of carbon dioxide would need to build up to cause a problem. So no, wearing a mask shouldn’t cause carbon dioxide poisoning. In addition to wearing a mask, be aware of your surroundings and use good sense. Encourage smart COVID-19 practices:
		

Does wearing a face mask, including those designed to be used during the COVID-19 pandemic, cause carbon dioxide intoxication in healthy individuals when used properly?		
New research findings contradict statements linking wearing face masks to carbon dioxide poisoning by trapping CO2. During the COVID-19 pandemic the wearing of face masks has become a highly political issue with some individuals falsely claiming that wearing face masks may be putting people's health at risk. The study published in the Annals of the American Thoracic Society shows otherwise. In ""Effect of Face Masks on Gas Exchange in Healthy Persons and Patients with COPD,"" Michael Campos, MD and co-authors assessed problems with gas exchange, that is, changes in oxygen level or carbon dioxide levels in healthy individuals as well as veterans with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or COPD before and while using surgical masks.

of CO2. When wearing a face mask, a fraction of carbon dioxide previously exhaled is inhaled  again with each respiratory cycle. Some media have been claiming that carbon dioxide may slowly  build up in the mask over time, causing medical issues related to the respiratory system such as  hypercapnia (a condition arising from too much carbon dioxide in the blood). 
		

Does wearing a face mask, including those designed to be used during the COVID-19 pandemic, cause carbon dioxide intoxication in healthy individuals when used properly?		
As several U.S. states try to enforce the wearing of face-coverings in an attempt to stop the spread of the coronavirus, there are some people who are refusing to do this. One of the newest conspiracies being touted as an excuse for this is that wearing masks can result in ‘hypercapnia’ or carbon dioxide toxicity. Except, with all reasonable face coverings ranging from surgical masks, to home-made face coverings and N95 filtered masks, this simply does not happen. The hastily-cobbled together graphics and memes currently circulating on social media claim that prolonged wearing of masks can increase levels of carbon dioxide, resulting in a myriad of symptoms.

among the three types of face masks tested. According to the literature, these concentrations  have no toxicological effect.

Does wearing a face mask, including those designed to be used during the COVID-19 pandemic, cause carbon dioxide intoxication in healthy individuals when used properly?		
The same Facebook post claimed face masks ""block your exhaling of carbon dioxide and then you breathe it back in … it destroys lung tissue."" The viral meme suggests wearing a mask can increase a wearer's chance of carbon dioxide poisoning. As noted, surgical masks are porous, allowing for normal respiratory function. Other cloth face masks typically are even more porous. It's important to note that the majority of the time, with health care workers as an exception, the general public is not wearing face masks for prolonged periods of time, meaning a dangerous build-up of CO2 is unlikely.
		

Does wearing a face mask, including those designed to be used during the COVID-19 pandemic, cause carbon dioxide intoxication in healthy individuals when used properly?		
We've seen lots of posts alerting people to something called hypercapnia - where there's too much carbon dioxide in the blood. ""This simply won't happen unless there is an air-tight fit and you rebreathe your air,"" says Prof Neal. Carbon dioxide molecules are tiny - far smaller than droplets containing coronavirus which the masks are designed to stop - and won't be trapped by a breathable material, particularly during relatively short periods like a bus journey. When you breathe out, the carbon dioxide will go through and round the type of masks most commonly worn, and is unlikely to build up to the extent that it causes health issues.

The researchers found that concentrations of CO2 were higher for all three mask groups, though cloth masks had the lowest concentration. Who's More at Risk? Increased levels of carbon dioxide can be problematic for people with breathing-related health conditions, like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). For example, people with COPD can have a hard time expelling CO2 effectively, which can increase their internal carbon dioxide levels. Also, researchers noted that the following factors were related to higher carbon dioxide levels in the triple mask study: Being of a younger age Being in a higher-temperature environment Moving around with a mask on Wearing an N-95 mask Possible Complications Wearing masks for a long time can have other complications, including: DepressionMuscle twitchesPapilledema—swelling of the optic discs behind the eyes due to increased pressure inside your headRespiratory failureSeizures The Best COVID Face Masks Is It Safe To Sleep With a Mask On?

Killer COVID-19 Masks? The Truth About Trapped Carbon Dioxide COVID-19 can kill. Now, according to a misguided Internet-fueled theory, masks can kill, too. All it takes is a mask-wearer who inhales freshly exhaled carbon dioxide repeatedly until dizzy, unconscious or dead. That, no doubt, would be a shocking development. In the real world, the average mask user without preexisting respiratory illness has nothing to worry about — except COVID-19.

Wearing a mask (preferably a cloth mask over a surgical mask) is recommended to protect people from community transmission of COVID-19. There are only a few exceptions to this public health recommendation, mostly focused on children under 2 years of age and people with serious medical conditions that can make it difficult to breathe through a mask or remove a mask if necessary. Otherwise, wearing a mask is safe and helpful for preventing the spread of COVID-19.

176,Tax avoidance costs £90 billion per year.,"What is the source of the £90 billion estimate for annual tax avoidance costs, and how is it calculated? <|end|>		
For the sake of argument I will take these at face value, but suspect that they drastically understate avoidance on issues such as inheritance tax and capital gains tax. Combine these figures though and the total comes to £11 bn for avoidance. Then add in HMRC’s admitted rate of non-payment of £3.4 billion, which is tax declared but not paid, and the £3.2 billion not paid due to errors, which would not show up in shadow economy data as this relates to declared activity. Or £89.4 billion. Call it £90 billion for the sake of argument.
		

What is the source of the £90 billion estimate for annual tax avoidance costs, and how is it calculated? <|end|>		
Based on his work I have estimated that evasion by the very wealthiest in the UK may amount to up to £7 billion a year. I am willing to reduce that a little now: automatic information exchange from tax havens may have cut this to £5billion a year. And as this will no9t impact the domestic economy or GDP it is additional to the estimate I have already made. These estimates do not, of course, include avoidance. So how much is that?
		

What is the source of the £90 billion estimate for annual tax avoidance costs, and how is it calculated? <|end|>		
Based on the work of Alex Cobham and Peter Jansky, in turn based on IMF based estimates, corporate profit shifting from the UK may be a surprisingly low £1 billion a year (other countries, like Germany and France, suffer a great deal more). And we know that the Treasury has admitted that tax incentivised incorporation costs maybe £3 billion a year. These figures are outside the scope of HMRC estimates. How much more is there? It’s hard to say. But if HMRC say that there are avoidance costs of at least £1.7bn in previous reports - which will not include the above two figures for reasons already noted. In addition they suggest that legal interpretation disputes that they lose - which is avoidance by any other name - costs at least £5.3 billion a year.
		

What is the source of the £90 billion estimate for annual tax avoidance costs, and how is it calculated? <|end|>		
So let me get this straight. The way you get to your estimate is as follows: 1. Use HMRCs numbers for everything except domestic evasion. 2. For domestic evasion, multiply these numbers together. UK GDP x Size of Shadow Economy x Average Tax rate

What is the source of the £90 billion estimate for annual tax avoidance costs, and how is it calculated? <|end|>		
And third, when it comes to tax avoidance some key elements of this activity, like corporate profit shifting by the likes of Google, and losses because of artificial incorporation to save national insurance, are ignored by HMRC when preparing their estimates because HMRC considers them to be legal. This, of course, is absurd: all avoidance is legal but HMRC use a very narrow definition of artificial tax avoidance that has to be notified to HMRC as the basis for this estimate, which means it too is inevitably, and by deliberate intent, massively understated. So let me suggest an alternative estimate of the UK tax gap in advance of HMRC's claim. This is based on the work I did for the European Union Socialists and Democrats group of MEPs in the EU parliament published in January this year, here. That report started by looking at available estimates of shadow economies. Two academic estimates were used, plus that which in underpins the EU official VAT gap estimate.
		

What is the source of the £90 billion estimate for annual tax avoidance costs, and how is it calculated? <|end|>		
Of course my estimate is a point in a range – just as HMRC’s is What’s the range? let’s call it £80bn to £100bn. Or £90bn, or thereabouts – as I suggested And I have already made amply clear why HMRC’s efforts are wrong In your book you claim that one of the main reasons for tax is to validate the use of your currency. What do you make of Facebook’s announcement that they are about to launch their own currency under the pretence of helping the poor.
		

What is the source of the £90 billion estimate for annual tax avoidance costs, and how is it calculated? <|end|>		
If the shadow economy is also a little bit smaller then I suspect that may well be because of efforts on offshore: I suspect these really are working now. But I strongly suspect that domestic tax evasion is an issue where HMRC is not winning. And if there data continues to deny the scale of this problem then they are continuing to fail us all. And that will still not do. £90 billion is equivalent to more than half the cost of the NHS a year, and almost 90% of the education budget. We could have a tax system that is so much more equitable if only we invested more in HMRC. It’s tiresome to have to still argue for this, but it seems I must.
		

What is the source of the £90 billion estimate for annual tax avoidance costs, and how is it calculated? <|end|>		
UK GDP of €2,602bn, times exchange rate of €1 = £0.72584 (£1,889bn), times estimated shadow economy of around 10% (say, £189bn), times ratio of tax to GDP of about 33% = about £62bn. This is an unashamedly broad-brush, top-down, ballpark estimate, as compared to HMRC more forensic bottom-up approach. It is not exactly derived from physical laws like E=mc^2, but a scientist might ask, what are the error bars on Richard’s estimate? I have shown the basis is almost wholly consistent with HMRC’s VAT gap
		

What is the source of the £90 billion estimate for annual tax avoidance costs, and how is it calculated? <|end|>		
There are big problems with this. First, some samples are far too small and so they have to resort to 'illustrative estimates' to publish tax gaps instead. These estimates account for about one-third of all the tax gap, and always seem incredibly low. Second, tax audits are not 100% accurate by a long way: not all tax need be recovered. So HMRC audit inefficiency is built into the estimates as a result. And third, they simply ignore the fact that 800,000 or so income tax returns and at least 400,000 corporation tax returns are simply not submitted each year: the estimates for losses from these are negligible but, most especially with regard to companies may well account for a considerable part of the tax evaded. The estimates of evasion are vastly understated as a result, and HMRC seems ridiculously comfortable with this.

177,President Trump is not on supplemental oxygen.,"Has there been an official update or statement from a credible medical source or the White House confirming the current status of President Trump's oxygen therapy following his COVID-19 diagnosis?		
There have been conflicting news about Trump's health, with his doctors saying the president is doing well and some sources claim that the next two days are critical for him. 17:18 The AP news agency reports that President Donald Trump on Friday was administered supplemental oxygen at the White House, just hours after being diagnosed with COVID-19. Navy Commander Dr. Sean Conley sidestepped the question about supplemental oxygen at a press briefing Saturday, saying Trump was not administered oxygen on Thursday or since he has been a patient at Walter Reed Medical Center. Stefan Simons, DW's correspondent in Washington, says the press conference leaves many questions unanswered.
		

Has there been an official update or statement from a credible medical source or the White House confirming the current status of President Trump's oxygen therapy following his COVID-19 diagnosis?		
Trump is not receiving supplemental oxygen as of late Friday night, according to a follow-up statement from Conley, his physician. Doctors can also turn to the experimental antiviral drug remdesivir, which the FDA authorized for use in hospitalized COVID-19 patients with mild to moderate symptoms. Indeed, President Trump began receiving remdesivir shortly after being hospitalized. “He is not requiring any supplemental oxygen, but in consultation with specialists we have elected to initiate remdesivir therapy,” Conley said in a memo sent from the White House just before midnight Friday. “He has completed his first dose and is resting comfortably.”
		

Has there been an official update or statement from a credible medical source or the White House confirming the current status of President Trump's oxygen therapy following his COVID-19 diagnosis?		
A source close to the White House said Trump has received supplemental oxygen since his illness began. Trump “definitely has had oxygen,” the source said. The source said it was before he went to Walter Reed but would not further specify when. CNN had reported Friday night that the President was having some difficulty breathing. Which all makes Conley’s answers decidedly and purposely evasive.
		

Has there been an official update or statement from a credible medical source or the White House confirming the current status of President Trump's oxygen therapy following his COVID-19 diagnosis?		
The doctors would not comment on whether Trump had received supplemental oxygen at any point. A source familiar with Trump's condition told NBC News that some of the president's vital signs that morning indicated the coronavirus could progress beyond mild illness. The White House released an update Saturday night, and Conley said the president was ""off supplemental oxygen with a saturation level between 96[%] and 98% all day."" He said Trump remained free of fever and continues to do well.
		

Has there been an official update or statement from a credible medical source or the White House confirming the current status of President Trump's oxygen therapy following his COVID-19 diagnosis?		
Conley’s answer left open the possibility that Trump was given supplemental oxygen while he was at the White House on Friday before being taken by helicopter to Walter Reed. The question is important because the need for oxygen can be one indicator of the severity of the COVID-19 illness. Trump’s doctors have said the President has received an experimental antibody cocktail treatment. According to Conley, Trump took the Regeneron antibody therapy on Friday, Oct. 2. At the Saturday press briefing at Walter Reed, Dr. Brian Garibaldi, another member of the president’s medical team, said, “The president received a special antibody therapy directed against the coronavirus.
		

Has there been an official update or statement from a credible medical source or the White House confirming the current status of President Trump's oxygen therapy following his COVID-19 diagnosis?		
A source close to the White House told CNN that Trump had been given supplemental oxygen on Friday. Trump “definitely has had oxygen,” the source said. However, on Saturday, Conley would not answer direct questions about whether Trump had ever been given oxygen. “Right now he is not on oxygen. Yesterday and today he was not on oxygen,” Conley said, adding, “We discussed it. Conley also would not answer a direct question about whether Trump had any sign of lung damage, saying only that the team had been checking for it.
		

Has there been an official update or statement from a credible medical source or the White House confirming the current status of President Trump's oxygen therapy following his COVID-19 diagnosis?		
He also repeatedly avoided questions about whether the president was treated with supplemental oxygen prior to Saturday, before finally saying he was not on oxygen on Thursday and had not been treated with oxygen when the president was at Walter Reed on Friday. However, he did not say whether the president had been treated with oxygen on Friday at the White House. Two sources confirmed to CBS News on Saturday afternoon that Mr. Trump received oxygen at the White House Friday before heading to Walter Reed. However, oxygen treatment is the default for patients in this situation, and it is unclear whether he had trouble breathing and actually needed it.
		

Has there been an official update or statement from a credible medical source or the White House confirming the current status of President Trump's oxygen therapy following his COVID-19 diagnosis?		
I’m not going to go into specifics of what the findings of any of that are. Can we just pin you down on one thing? Has he ever been on supplemental oxygen? I know you keep saying right now, but should we read into the fact that he had been previously? So he has not been on it during his COVID treatment? Is that accurate.
		

Has there been an official update or statement from a credible medical source or the White House confirming the current status of President Trump's oxygen therapy following his COVID-19 diagnosis?		
The president reportedly received supplemental oxygen Friday at the White House when he had difficulty breathing, according to The New York Times and the Associated Press. He was transferred to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center later that day. The White House declined to comment when contacted by CNBC. White House physician Dr. Sean Conley and Dr. Sean Dooley, a pulmonologist at Walter Reed, told reporters Saturday morning that the president was not using supplemental oxygen and was not having difficulty breathing.
		

Has there been an official update or statement from a credible medical source or the White House confirming the current status of President Trump's oxygen therapy following his COVID-19 diagnosis?		
People who have contracted COVID-19 can often have trouble breathing because of the disease’s impact on the lungs, and they can require either a low flow of oxygen through a tube under the nose, or a larger mask pushing oxygen into their lungs. Conley was evasive when asked about whether Trump was ever given supplemental oxygen. The doctor repeatedly said Trump is not on oxygen “right now.” When pressed by reporters, he allowed that Trump had not needed oxygen at all on Saturday, and he said, “Thursday. No oxygen. None at this moment… And yesterday with the team when we were all here, he was not on oxygen.”

In case of a high-altitude war, India is better placed than China as many of the IAF aircraft are capable of flying at high altitudes in all-weather conditions with support from nearby airbases. PLAAF aircraft may have to fly with limited supplies and fuel due to rough weather conditions in their airbases near Tibet. China has been, however, developing military airfields in Tibet since the last decade and has significantly enhanced the ground facilities for the operation of PLAAF’s combat aircraft. The PLAAF has an operational force of at least 600 fourth-generation fighters including J-10B/C, J-11B, J-16, and Su-30.

But I defer to Crobato as the lead Chinese aviation watcher among us. His knowledge goes beyond just aircraft to engines, radars, software and many other things. If you haven't notice, interest in the PLAAF generates more computer graphics, story postings and photoshopped fakes than any other air force outside the USAF. As far as the Su-27/30 crashes are concerned, there has been a long thread on that. The only authoritative figure is Jane's which confirmed only five a/c written off from the Sukhoi fleet with two crashes and three damaged by a typhoon. High but nothing catastrophic, considering the PLAAF now operates over 100 Su-27/30/J-11s (I'm using a very conservative estimate of known deliveries, 50 Su-27s from batches in 1992 and 1996, 38 Su-30MKKs in 1999, 2000, and 14 J-11s assembled in 2000).

Through much of the 1970s and 1980s, the PLAAF was stagnant, following the unfortunate death of their chief Lin Bao who challenged Mao in a power struggle and then perished in an air crash while attempting to flee China. <3> Adding to the PLAAF’s doctrinal isolation was an inventory of obsolete platforms and equipment of Soviet⎯origin crude reverse engineered systems that were poorly supported by a struggling domestic aviation industry. Though many strategic analysts attribute the rejuvenation of the PLAAF to Chinese politician Deng Xiaoping, there are many drivers that have contributed to the revival of the PLAAF as a potent fighting force and a key determinant of contemporary Chinese military strategy. Despite many recent analyses in India that point to a rather optimistic and skewed capability assessment in favour of the IAF, this paper will argue that policy and security planners would do well to take note of remarkable progress in the PLAAF’s doctrinal advancements, training philosophy and plugging capability gaps with a judicious mix of indigenous equipment and state⎯of⎯the⎯art Russian equipment.

Short Range Conventionally armed SRBMs like the DF⎯11 and DF⎯15 fired from mobile launchers well inside Tibet would exploit their 350⎯800+ NM ranges to hit targets comprising of airfields, logistics nodes, ammunition dumps and the likes with a reported accuracy of upto 5 metres, though the more likely accuracy for a larger number of missiles is around 30 metres. As per conservative estimates, China had over 130 military satellites in 2015 and had doubled its launch rate during the period of 2009⎯2014 as compared to the period of 2003⎯2008. In comparison, India’s Cartosat, RISAT, INSAT, GSAT and IRNSS family of satellites are woefully inadequate, both in terms of numbers and capability to offer India any kind of parity. What this can achieve is to blunt the IAF’s ability to launch its potent Air Superiority Fighter, Multi⎯Role Combat Aircraft and Ground Attack fleets comprising the Su⎯30 MKI, Mirage⎯2000, MiG⎯29 and Jaguar aircraft with the primary aim to fight for some degree of dominance over the PLAAF over a limited theatre of operation.

The Chinese Air Force, the People’s Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF), is stronger compared with the Indian Air Force (IAF) in terms of fleet and strategic inventory, but the IAF deploys more reliable platforms and strategic bases, combined with experienced troops. This analysis is based on available facts and technical specifications; the actual performance of the forces and aerial assets may vary based on the skills and adaptability to actual conditions. - PLAAF is the second biggest air force in the world whereas IAF is the fourth largest. - PLAAF’s mammoth fleet of fighter aircraft and advanced air defence systems poses an intimidating challenge to the IAF’s limited fleet size.

According to a report in Hindustan Times (HT), a government official said the top-of-the-line fighter jets are staying away from the LAC lest the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) radars in occupied Aksai Chin identify their frequency signatures and use it to jam in the worst-case scenario.

In Philippines, coronavirus crisis led to massive PhilHealth corruption, whistle-blowers claim - Senate hears ‘mafia’ executives unevenly allocated Covid-19 funds, overpaid for equipment and hoped to cover this by raising overseas foreign worker premiums - Rodrigo Duterte appointed former general Ricardo Morales to clean up the agency after the WellMed scandal last year, but it could now face bankruptcy The whistle-blowers, two of whom recently resigned from the Philippine Health Corporation (PhilHealth), made the claims against their former bosses during three Senate hearings lasting 28 hours.
		

What specific evidence or statements did Senate President Vicente Sotto III provide to support his claim that hardheaded Filipinos are to blame for the COVID-19 cases in the country?		
Senate President Vicente Sotto III told This Week in Asia that he believed the former staff members. “Throughout the course of the hearings, none of the three faltered or changed their statements, unlike the officials in question. That led me to say in the hearing, ‘the best thing about telling the truth is that you don’t have to remember what you said’.” Just a year ago, President Rodrigo Duterte sacked PhilHealth CEO-president Roy Ferrer and told the entire board to resign after employees of WellMed Dialysis Centre in suburban Manila revealed they had submitted nearly 1 million pesos (US$20,000) worth of bogus claims using the names of dead patients as well as living ones who did not undergo dialysis.

At that time, the outbreak was centred in China, with Wuhan having nearly 10,000 cases while the Philippines and Italy had recorded one each, and the US and Thailand had 14 cases each. Morales also came under fire for the purchase of overpriced PCR testing kits. When Drilon pointed this out during an earlier Senate hearing on the pandemic, the cost dropped from 8,150 pesos (US$167) to 3,409 pesos (US$70) each, “which on the basis of the projected 2 million tests, saved the government over 9 billion pesos”, Drilon said. Philippines failing to contain coronavirus, despite multiple lockdowns Keith, who resigned shortly before testifying on August 4, said he came forward because he “pitied” overseas foreign workers (OFWs) after PhilHealth announced plans in May to require them to pay a double premium – their share plus their employers’ share – equal to 2.75 to 3 per cent of annual salary, even though they could not use PhilHealth while abroad.

There have been widespread complaints about the government's response to the outbreak, including long delays in the delivery of cash and food aid to millions of poor families and the inability to reach a targeted number of daily virus tests. The Philippines remains a Southeast Asian hot spot for the virus, with more than 80,000 confirmed cases, including nearly 2,000 deaths.

More crucially, the Philippine Senate, dominated by Duterte-friendly statesmen, have openly challenged the president, questioning his constitutional prerogative to unilaterally abrogate an agreement that was ratified by the Philippine legislature. In early March, a group of senators from across the political spectrum, including Senate President Vicente Sotto III, challenged Duterte’s decision at the Philippine Supreme Court. The top senators asked the country’s highest court to “issue an order” to “refer [Duterte’s] Notice of Withdrawal to the Senate of the Philippines for its concurrence.” It was the first time that the country’s political establishment openly defied and legally challenged the authoritarian-leaning Duterte, underscoring the depth of the Philippine-U.S. alliance in the psyche of the Manila elite.

Keith earlier said 14.9 billion pesos (US$306 million) was advanced unevenly to 771 hospitals starting from April, with two hospitals in Davao City getting the biggest payments even though they treated fewer Covid-19 patients than those in Metro Manila – which not only got smaller amounts, but have also not been paid by PhilHealth for their coronavirus-related expenses. Cash advances of such excessive amounts are illegal, Keith said. To date, only 1 billion pesos has been liquidated. Morales justified the board’s decision to approve the IRM on January 31, saying “we knew how [coronavirus] hit the other countries and so we were in a state of panic, so we wanted to be pre-emptive”. But this explanation did not wash with Senate minority leader Franklin Drilon, who branded it as a “cover up” since the virus had not yet spread that widely by January 31.

The research found that men who have frequent sex, do not have the chance to suffer prostate cancer hence others should follow in the same act, she added. “We found that men reporting higher compared to lower ejaculatory frequency in adulthood were less likely to be subsequently diagnosed with prostate cancer. This large prospective study provides the strongest evidence to date of a beneficial role of ejaculation in the prevention of prostate cancer,” the researchers said. 13 thoughts on “Men must have sex at least 21 times a month, to avoid prostate cancer – expert”

Travel.State.Gov > Travel Advisories > Mexico Travel Advisory Reissued after periodic review with general security updates, and the removal of obsolete COVID-19 page links. Country Summary: Violent crime – such as homicide, kidnapping, carjacking, and robbery – is widespread and common in Mexico. The U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in many areas of Mexico, as travel by U.S. government employees to certain areas is prohibited or restricted.
		

Is there credible and current evidence or official reports from reliable sources, such as government agencies or reputable news organizations, confirming that Mexico is on a ""red alert"" specifically due to children being targeted for kidnapping to harvest their organs?		
[492] This is a curious and baseless complaint given that the report itself identifies the victims and specific state entities implicated in the vast majority of cases. [493] Moreover, contrary to your claim, the report does provide detailed descriptions of the cases based on extensive evidence culled from multiple sources—ranging from medical examinations, crime scene photographs, and witness testimony, to judicial rulings, written and oral communications by officials, and videos of court proceedings, among others. You also “lament” that “neither the federal government nor any Mexican authority was even informed of the accusations against them, to say nothing of being given the opportunity to provide their version of the facts.” [494] In fact, during our two-year investigation, we consistently sought meetings with the relevant authorities in order to obtain their versions of events.

Given that cartels have committed serious crimes in Mexico in recent years, including many disappearances, it is reasonable for prosecutors to investigate the possibility that the perpetrators of such crimes are members of criminal groups. It is also reasonable to examine the background of the victim for information relevant to his whereabouts or possible motives for his abduction. However, according to nearly every family interviewed by Human Rights Watch, law enforcement and prosecutors’ reflexive assumption in disappearance cases is that the victim was targeted for belonging to a criminal group. Authorities repeatedly embraced this theory, and indeed often voiced it to families, before undertaking a preliminary investigation into the case.

In addition, authorities relied on families to perform investigative duties that are the job of officials, in some cases encouraging families to take actions that involved serious risk. Daniel Obregón Hernández was abducted together with more than a dozen men and boys when armed, masked men came to their neighborhood in Monterrey, Nuevo León on July 17, 2010, and started loading young men into their trucks at gunpoint.[211] According to Obregón’s mother—who immediately filed a complaint with the public prosecutor’s office—a man nicknamed “Aciva” was initially rounded up with the other victims, but was set free when one of the abductors said he knew him.

Mexico’s National Human Rights Commission registered more than 6,100 unidentified bodies from January 2007 to December 2011.[398] It is reasonable to presume that hundreds if not thousands of these remains belong to individuals whose families have reported them as disappeared, and are currently searching for them. However, while the federal government has proven its capacity to set up national databases of stolen cars and of police officers with criminal records, it has failed to set up similar registries for the disappeared or unidentified bodies. Due to the lack of these federal registries, families who want to search for their loved ones at a national level are forced to travel from state to state leading their own searches.

The transcription was perfect, right? This was not as perfect as that, but pretty good,” Trump said. (Trump’s mention of “the letter” and “transcription” was a reference to his recent impeachment.) As large public gatherings around the United States are being canceled and some colleges are suspending in-person classes to avoid the spread of the disease, PolitiFact decided to fact-check Trump on his “bottom line” assessment that anybody who wants a test will get one. He’s wrong. Current supply of the test is limited, and clinicians are the ones who decide whether a patient meets criteria to warrant testing. Testing is not as easy as just calling your doctor or pharmacy, saying you want to be tested for COVID-19 and getting it done.

The counter-narrative began almost instantly. After the U.S. count of Covid-19 cases began an inexorable rise in June, the White House sought to assure Americans that the increase was, basically, an illusion, created by an increase in testing for the novel coronavirus. In a June 15 tweet, President Trump said testing “makes us look bad.” At his campaign rally in Tulsa five days later, he said he had asked his “people” to “slow the testing down, please.” At a White House press conference last week, he told reporters, “When you test, you create cases.” And in an interview with Fox News that aired Sunday, Trump could not have been clearer: “Cases are up because we have the best testing in the world and we have the most testing.”

The news will mean a dramatic reduction in the in-person rallies Mr. Trump can hold in October and has cast doubt on whether the President will be able to participate in the next presidential debate scheduled for October 15. Announcing his condition, Mr. Trump tweeted: “Tonight, FLOTUS and I tested positive for COVID-19. We will begin our quarantine and recovery process immediately. The White House sent out a memorandum from Mr. Trump’s physician Sean Conley, after Mr. Trump’s announcement, confirming the infections and saying the Trumps will remain at home during their convalescence.

Photographs of a man with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, and Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath are being circulated on Twitter and Facebook with the claim that he is the father of one of the accused in the alleged gang-rape case in Hathras. A 19-year-old Dalit woman from Uttar Pradesh’s Hathras was allegedly tortured and gang-raped by four upper-caste men on September 14. According to reports, the four accused in the case are Ramu, Lavkush, Ravi and Sandeep. Additional Director General of Police Prashant Kumar however, said that the woman’s postmortem report showed that she died of neck injuries. “The perpetrator of Hathras victim ** ** Sandeep’s father’s memorable images make everything evident,” reads the viral message.
		

Does verified evidence or credible sources confirm that the man in the picture is indeed the father of Sandeep Thakur, the accused in the Hathras case?		
The image of Dwivedi with Adityanatah was found in a 2017 post. Alt News performed a keyword search on YouTube and found a report by channel News24 UP and Uttrakhand where the family of the accused in the Hathras case are being interviewed. At 8:33 mark, the reporter asked, “You are Sandip’s father. Sandip the one whose name was first taken…” This establishes that Sandip’s father and the man in the viral images, BJP leader Dr Shyam Prakash Dwivedi, are not the same person. Thus pictures of BJP leader Dr Shyam Prakash Dwivedi who is being investigated in an alleged rape case in Prayagraj are being linked to the death of a Dalit woman in Hathras.

On September 16, two days after the Hathras incident, DNA reported that Prayagraj police registered a case against BJP leader Shyam Prakash Dwivedi and Dr Anil Dwivedi for allegedly raping a BA student. Alt News rummaged through Dwivedi’s Facebook profile and found two of the viral images in a collage from 2014.

But the actual turn of events did not allow for that. Thakurs, the caste group to which the accused belong, form the majority in her village along with Brahmins. Out of about 200 houses, only four are Dalit households. The immediate family, fellow villagers and relatives gathered at the house have all experienced caste-based ill treatment. The main accused, Sandeep’s father, had spent three months in jail under the SC/ST Act for assaulting the grandfather of the victim, the year she was born.

WASHINGTON — Former President Donald Trump tested positive for Covid-19 three days before his first presidential debate against Joe Biden, with a subsequent pre-debate test coming back negative, three sources familiar with the matter confirmed Wednesday. Former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows revealed Trump's positive test in a new book, first reported by The Guardian, which cited an excerpt. In the book, Meadows said Trump seemed “a little tired” and suspected that he might have a “slight cold” before he found out about the positive result on his way to a rally in Pennsylvania. Trump tested positive again on Oct. 1 and was hospitalized the next day, when he announced the results on Twitter.

In a statement Wednesday, Trump denied that he was sick at the time of the first positive result. “The story of me having COVID prior to, or during, the first debate is Fake News,"" Trump said. ""In fact, a test revealed that I did not have COVID prior to the debate.” Two sources familiar with the matter characterized Trump's initial test on Sept. 26 as a ""false positive"" because of the subsequent negative test. One source said that the negative test came just hours after the positive one and that Trump tested negative again on Sept. 30, a day after the debate.

Trump was questioned about the timeline of his Covid test at an NBC News town hall on Oct. 15. He told moderator Savannah Guthrie that his first positive Covid test was on Oct. 1. When he was pressed further, Trump gave vague answers about whether he had been tested before he took the debate stage, given that the rules requested that he and Biden come with negative results. Asked whether he took a Covid test on the day of the debate, Trump said, “I probably did, and I took a test the day before, and the day before, and I was always in great shape, and I was in great shape for the debate.” The evening of the debate, city and clinic officials in Cleveland said at least 11 positive coronavirus tests could be traced to members of the media or organizers of the event.

White House adviser Kellyanne Conway also tested positive, on Oct. 2. A day later, former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who attended the Rose Garden event and prepped Trump for his debate, said he was in the hospital after having tested positive earlier in the day. On Oct. 3, Meadows said in an interview that Trump’s condition took a turn for the worse when his blood oxygen level dropped suddenly, indicating that his condition was worse than he and his aides had made public. Trump returned to the White House on Oct. 5 after he received the experimental monoclonal antibody treatment at Walter Reed. That day, White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany and two of her deputies tested positive. In addition to 11 people tied to Trump who contracted Covid during that time period, three Republican senators also tested positive.

Presently, two types of diagnostic tests are approved by the U.S Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to diagnose COVID-19: a molecular test and an antigen test. In molecular tests, the viral genetic material is detected using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The test is done using biological fluid collected from a nasal or throat swab or using saliva. Some at-home test kits, such as nasal swab kits and saliva kits, are also effective in detecting coronavirus. In antigen tests, biological samples collected from nasal or throat swabs are used to detect certain viral proteins.

False-negative results could lead people to believe that they haven’t been infected when they actually have, potentially preventing them from returning to regular activities, such as work or school. And false-positive results would cause people to think they have been infected and have developed an immune response, when they haven’t. Incorrect results could also provide a skewed picture of how many people have actually been infected and what the true death rate of COVID-19 is, experts have stressed.

This article explains what we know so far about both nucleic acid tests and antibody detection tests for the SARS-CoV-2 virus, and what factors can affect the reliability of an individual test result. As with all lab tests, a number of factors determine the accuracy of a COVID-19 test result. These include not only the instrument and chemical reagents used to perform the test, but also the timing and quality of specimen collection and the biology of the individual patient. Laboratory tests are characterized by their ability to detect a positive case (sensitivity) and their ability to determine a negative case (specificity). So a sensitive test is less likely to provide a false-negative result and a specific test is less likely to provide a false-positive result.

In the wake of the news, as pundits have struggled to unpack the implications of what Trump’s diagnosis means for the election, conspiracy theorists who have downplayed the impact of COVID-19 have reveled in the news. “We’re hitting this sort of perfect nexus of political and medical disinformation right now,” says Brian Friedberg, senior researcher at the Harvard Shorenstein’s Technology and Social Change Project.

Making False Statements About Covid-19’s Spread and Possible Treatments Throughout the pandemic, President Trump has made repeated false and unsupported statements about Covid-19, contradicting scientific research and the advice of government experts. His statements have caused confusion, sown distrust of government, and politicized commonsense public health measures, making it difficult to control the spread of the coronavirus and stabilize the economy. As the first coronavirus cases were reported in the United States and top government health officials expressed concern that the virus would spread throughout the country for months, President Trump claimed that the number of infections would soon “be down to close to zero” and that the virus would disappear ""like a miracle.""
		

Did US President Donald Trump receive a COVID-19 diagnosis that was later revealed to be fabricated, and if so, did he use it strategically in his re-election campaign?		
He has also falsely claimed that the mortality rate for Covid-19 is like that for the flu, that 99 percent of cases are “totally harmless,” and that the United States has “one of the lowest mortality rates [for the disease] in the world.” The Trump administration has encouraged state officials to disseminate false information. Vice President Mike Pence told governors to spread the president’s misleading claim that the uptick in coronavirus cases is due to an increase in testing. Trump reportedly acknowledged that he had intentionally downplayed the threat of the virus during interviews with journalist Bob Woodward in February and March 2020, stating that although he recognized the deadly nature of the disease, “I wanted to always play it down . . . I still like playing it down, because I don’t want to create a panic.”
		

Did US President Donald Trump receive a COVID-19 diagnosis that was later revealed to be fabricated, and if so, did he use it strategically in his re-election campaign?		
He later continued to mock others for wearing masks and, just hours before announcing his own diagnosis, claimed that “the end of the pandemic is in sight, and next year will be one of the greatest years in the history of our country.” Trump later repeated at a rally, held at the White House, that the pandemic would “disappear.” In October 2020, the White House’s Office of Science and Technology Policy issued a press release that listed “ending the Covid-19 pandemic” as one of President Trump’s greatest accomplishments during his first term in office. President Trump’s false and unsupported statements regarding the spread of and treatments for the disease have contributed to the United States’ failure to manage the crisis effectively. The president’s comments, as well of those of his allies in government and the media, have an impact on how seriously Americans view the threat of Covid-19 and the degree to which they adhere to guidance from public health experts.
		

Did US President Donald Trump receive a COVID-19 diagnosis that was later revealed to be fabricated, and if so, did he use it strategically in his re-election campaign?		
For instance, the president’s medical team declined to say when the president last tested negative for the virus. His medical team issued contradictory statements about the timeline for his diagnosis and the severity of his symptoms — at one point admitting that they misrepresented his condition to avoid causing alarm — and flouted experts’ guidelines for isolation to stop the spread of the virus. The president may have also risked the health of Secret Service agents when he decided to leave the hospital to greet his supporters from his motorcade just one day after he began a steroid treatment used for patients with severe responses to Covid-19 (a decision one attending physician at Walter Reed described as “insanity”). Shortly after returning to the White House (and less than six days after he announced testing positive), the president met in person with aides, despite warnings from medical experts that he could have still been infectious at the time.
		

Did US President Donald Trump receive a COVID-19 diagnosis that was later revealed to be fabricated, and if so, did he use it strategically in his re-election campaign?		
Just two days later, Trump held an in-person rally for hundreds of supporters on the White House lawn (which, in addition to raising serious safety concerns, may have violated the Hatch Act). Since his diagnosis, the president has also continued to undermine the authority and legitimacy of federal public health agencies and experts and spread misinformation. In the midst of his intensive Covid-19 treatment, Trump urged the public, “Don’t be afraid of Covid. Don’t let it dominate your life,” contradicting warnings from the CDC and National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease Director Dr. Anthony Fauci about the seriousness of the disease. Less than five days after first receiving an experimental drug, Trump touted it as a miracle “cure,” even though the drug had not completed clinical trials.
		

Did US President Donald Trump receive a COVID-19 diagnosis that was later revealed to be fabricated, and if so, did he use it strategically in his re-election campaign?		
The president has also repeatedly promoted the use of the antimalarial drugs chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine to treat Covid-19 — going so far as to announce that he was taking the latter as a preventative measure — despite a lack of scientific evidence of their effectiveness and against the advice of government experts. And most notoriously, President Trump suggested that Covid-19 could be cured by injecting disinfectants or by “hit[ting] the body with a tremendous” light, a patently unscientific — and dangerous — claim that led to an uptick in calls to poison control centers due to exposure to cleaning agents. In September 2020, as the death toll from Covid-19 surpassed 200,000 in the United States, Trump again claimed that the coronavirus would “go away” and that the United States was “rounding the corner” — statements contradicted by Dr. Fauci. Trump also falsely claimed that Covid-19 affects “virtually nobody” younger than 18, despite reports from the CDC and the WHO that young people play a significant role in spreading the virus and reports of children being hospitalized in rising numbers.

Hours before Trump announced he had contracted the virus, the White House said a top aide who had traveled with him during the week had tested positive. “Tonight, @FLOTUS and I tested positive for COVID-19. We will begin our quarantine and recovery process immediately,” Trump tweeted just before 1 a.m. Trump was last seen by reporters returning to the White House on Thursday evening and did not appear visibly ill. Trump is 74 years old, putting him at higher risk of serious complications from a virus that has infected more than 7 million people nationwide.

Former White House counsellor Kellyanne Conway, the president of the University of Notre Dame, and at least two Republican lawmakers who were also present at the event - Utah Sen. Mike Lee and North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis - announced Friday they had tested positive and were isolating. Trump's diagnosis came during an already turbulent period in Washington and around the world, with the U.S. gripped in a heated presidential election amid the human and economic toll of the virus. Trump's immediate campaign events were all cancelled, and his next debate with Democrat Joe Biden, scheduled for Oct. 15, is now in question. Trump has been trying all year - and as recently as Wednesday - to convince the American public that the worst of the pandemic is past, and he has consistently played down concerns about being personally vulnerable.

- Later in the day, the White House announced Trump would go to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center. In the hours immediately following Trump’s announcement, with few other details available, some turned to speculation. Among the posts to gain traction online were posts suggesting that the president was not actually sick, but using a fabricated diagnosis to benefit his reelection campaign. On the other side, some implied without substantiation that “the left” may have deliberately spread the virus to him.

191,Flu shots lead to severe or life-threatening conditions making them unsafe.,"What is the evidence or data from reputable health organizations, such as the CDC or WHO, regarding the safety profile and risk of severe or life-threatening conditions associated with flu shots?		
- people with chronic health conditions as well as their caregivers - have had an allergic reaction to the flu shot in the past - are currently sick with a moderate to severe fever The flu shot is a safe, effective treatment with few side effects. Still, if you’re concerned, you can talk to your doctor or pharmacist.
		

What is the evidence or data from reputable health organizations, such as the CDC or WHO, regarding the safety profile and risk of severe or life-threatening conditions associated with flu shots?		
Concern about vaccine safety is often cited by persons who refuse vaccination, including health-care workers. When educating patients about adverse events, clinicians should provide Vaccine Information Statements (available at http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/vis), and emphasize the risks and benefits of vaccination. Providers should inform patients or parents that 1) TIV contains noninfectious killed viruses and cannot cause influenza; 2) LAIV contains weakened influenza viruses that cannot replicate outside the upper respiratory tract and are unlikely to infect others; 3) many patients will experience no side effects and most known side effects are mild, transient, and manageable, such as injection-site pain after receipt of TIV or rhinorrhea after LAIV; and 4) concomitant symptoms or respiratory disease unrelated to vaccination with either TIV or LAIV can occur after vaccination. Patients concerned about more severe adverse events might be reassured by discussing the many safety studies available, the safety monitoring systems currently in use, and the immunization provider or program's previous experience with influenza vaccines.
		

What is the evidence or data from reputable health organizations, such as the CDC or WHO, regarding the safety profile and risk of severe or life-threatening conditions associated with flu shots?		
The study was designed as a follow-up to a smaller study that suggested there was a possible tie. Researchers looked at three flu seasons (2012-13, 2013-14 and 2014-15) and found no link between flu shots and increased risk for miscarriage. There’s a myth out there that flu shots don’t work. While getting vaccinated doesn’t protect you from every flu virus, it can significantly reduce your chances of getting the flu and your risk of having flu-related complications while pregnant. For example, the CDC reports that vaccination has been shown to cut the risk of pregnant women developing flu-associated acute respiratory illnesses by about one-half. Yes, they are completely safe for your developing baby. Studies show that getting a flu shot does not increase the risk of birth defects.

Many moms-to-be ask me: Is the flu shot safe when you’re pregnant? Are there any side effects? What trimester is the best time to get a flu shot? Influenza – the seasonal flu – is responsible for millions of illnesses in the United States every year, and pregnant women have a higher risk of serious illness. But getting an annual flu shot can greatly reduce your risk of getting sick and it helps protect baby, too. Read on to learn more about flu shots during pregnancy, how they protect you and baby, why you may be more susceptible to getting the flu while pregnant, and more.
		

What is the evidence or data from reputable health organizations, such as the CDC or WHO, regarding the safety profile and risk of severe or life-threatening conditions associated with flu shots?		
A nongovernment working group was established by the National Vaccine Advisory Committee to provide an independent review of safety data, with members representing other federal advisory committees as well as experts in internal medicine, pediatrics, immunology, and vaccine safety (314). Data from the first 2 months of implementation of H1N1 vaccination from VAERS and VSD suggested a similar safety profile for influenza A (H1N1) 2009 monovalent vaccines and seasonal influenza vaccines. As of July 2010, analysis and review of vaccine safety data from numerous systems were underway (314,316). Comparisons of LAIV and TIV Efficacy or Effectiveness
		

What is the evidence or data from reputable health organizations, such as the CDC or WHO, regarding the safety profile and risk of severe or life-threatening conditions associated with flu shots?		
What you should know about getting a flu shot while pregnant Yes. Flu shots are considered safe for pregnant women, and they have been for some time. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has done a lot of work to examine the safety of the flu vaccine during pregnancy. The CDC and its partners have conducted several studies, which have all shown the vaccine to be safe for pregnant women and their babies. No. Studies show that the flu shot does not cause an increased risk for miscarriage. This comes from one of the largest studies examining influenza vaccination and the risk of miscarriage conducted by the CDC in 2019.
		

What is the evidence or data from reputable health organizations, such as the CDC or WHO, regarding the safety profile and risk of severe or life-threatening conditions associated with flu shots?		
It finds that while no vaccine is 100 percent safe, very few adverse events are shown to be caused by vaccines. In addition, the evidence shows that vaccines do not cause several conditions. For example, the MMR vaccine is not associated with autism or childhood diabetes. Also, the DTaP vaccine is not associated with diabetes and the influenza vaccine given as a shot does not exacerbate asthma. Adverse Effects of Vaccines will be of special interest to the National Vaccine Program Office, the VICP, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, vaccine safety researchers and manufacturers, parents, caregivers, and health professionals in the private and public sectors.
		

What is the evidence or data from reputable health organizations, such as the CDC or WHO, regarding the safety profile and risk of severe or life-threatening conditions associated with flu shots?		
Providers concerned about the risk for severe adverse events or who observe or report a severe adverse event after vaccination should keep in mind that relatively common events will occur by chance after vaccination. For example, one study used the background rate of spontaneous abortion to estimate that 397 per 1 million vaccinated pregnant women would be predicted to have a spontaneous abortion within 1 day of vaccination (477). Even rare events will be observed by chance after vaccination if large numbers of persons are vaccinated, as occurs with annual influenza immunization campaigns. For example, if a cohort of 10 million individuals was vaccinated, approximately 22 cases of GBS and six cases of sudden death would be expected to occur within 6 weeks of vaccination as coincident background cases unrelated to vaccination (477).
		

What is the evidence or data from reputable health organizations, such as the CDC or WHO, regarding the safety profile and risk of severe or life-threatening conditions associated with flu shots?		
Flu can cause fever, chills, muscle ache and cold symptoms. People who have the flu usually feel very ill for about a week. Only rarely does the flu cause serious complications, such as pneumonia. Babies, toddlers, people who have certain medical conditions, pregnant women and older people have a higher risk of those types of complications, though, because their immune system is weaker than a typical healthy adult's is. Flu vaccinations involve injecting weakened or inactivated viruses (or parts of viruses) under the skin or into a muscle. There is also a flu vaccine in the form of a nasal spray. It has been approved for children between the ages of 2 and 17 years.

2. Nigeria gained independence from colonial rule in 1960. Nigeria gained independence from the British empire in 1960, initially adopting a British style of government with Abubakar Tafawa Balewa as the first Nigerian head of government (prime minister). The country then had a population of over 45 million people. 3. Nigeria has been ruled by military leaders for a combined 29 years.
		

What was the recorded population of Nigeria at the time of its independence in 1960?		
When independence was gained in 1960, tribalism was a dominant force and ethnic divisions widespread. Home to 180 million people, one quarter of the entire African continent’s citizens, Nigeria is Africa’s most populous nation. The British, who colonised the nation for the first 60 years of the 20th century, ruled over some 250 tribes often by playing one off against the other. So when independence was gained in October 1960, tribalism was a powerful force.
		

What was the recorded population of Nigeria at the time of its independence in 1960?		
From self-rule to civil war: Nigeria’s independence, 60 years on Nigeria became independent from Britain on October 1, 1960, and today has Africa’s largest economy. FRANCE 24’s Nicolas Germain looks at how the fledgling independent state was soon mired in a devastating civil war in the eastern Biafra region that would claim nearly two million lives. Africa’s most populous nation became independent from Britain on October 1, 1960, a little more than 100 years after colonisers first arrived. The spread of Western education by Christian missionaries was strongly resisted, especially by Muslim leaders in the north.
		

What was the recorded population of Nigeria at the time of its independence in 1960?		
After Nigeria gained its independence from Britain in 1960, the country divided into ethnically defined regions—the Igbo people occupied the southeast, the Yoruba the southwest, and the Hausa and Fulani the north. Tensions grew as the nation’s military took power following the achievement of Nigerian independence and fighting broke out among the regions, resulting in as many as 30,000 Igbo deaths at the hands of the Yoruba. On May 30, 1967, Colonel Emeka Ojukwu seceded the Igbo territory, declaring it to be the Republic of Biafra. With the help of Great Britain, the Nigerian federal government reacted quickly, gaining control of the oil-rich southeast coast and blockading supplies to the region, causing severe famine and leading to the deaths of nearly two million civilians and 100,000 military personnel.
		

What was the recorded population of Nigeria at the time of its independence in 1960?		
Five weeks after its secession from Nigeria, the breakaway Republic of Biafra is attacked by Nigerian government forces. In 1960, Nigeria gained independence from Britain. The new country was formed from a colonial amalgamation of different regions with different majority ethnic groups, including the Yoruba, Igbo and Hausa-Fulani. Six years later, a set of back-to-back military coups installed an Igbo leader, who was then removed in a counter-coup organized largely by officers from the Hausa-Fulani-dominated North. In the chaos that followed, thousands of Igbos living in the North were massacred, prompting tens of thousands of Igbos to flee to the east, where their people were the dominant ethnic group.
		

What was the recorded population of Nigeria at the time of its independence in 1960?		
On Oct. 1, Nigeria celebrates its Diamond Jubilee — marking 60 years since the country became an independent nation with the end of colonial rule. With an estimated population of about 204 million people, Nigeria today is the most populous Black nation on Earth and the seventh most populous country in the world. There is so much to learn about Nigeria, its people, and its cultures. With so much history and cultural richness, there are many lessons to be learned from Nigeria’s impact on the African continent and the world at large. Global Citizen celebrates the resilience and ingenuity of the Nigerian people on this historic and important day.

What was the recorded population of Nigeria at the time of its independence in 1960?		
- Nigeria under Umaru Musa Yar’Adua and Goodluck Jonathan Nigeria was granted independence on October 1, 1960. A new constitution established a federal system with an elected prime minister and a ceremonial head of state. The NCNC, now headed by Azikiwe (who had taken control after Macaulay’s death in 1946), formed a coalition with Balewa’s NPC after neither party won a majority in the 1959 elections. Balewa continued to serve as the prime minister, a position he had held since 1957, while Azikiwe took the largely ceremonial position of president of the Senate.
		

What was the recorded population of Nigeria at the time of its independence in 1960?		
Nigeria gained independence from the United Kingdom on 1 October 1960. And an Executive Council, made up entirely of Nigerians, was led by a Prime Minister, Alhaji Sir Abubakar Tafawa Balewa. Its first government was a coalition of conservative parties, and it came into power on the back of increasingly enthusiastic demands for political independence from colonial powers that swept across much of the African continent during the middle of the 20th Century. The British recognised that the independence drive had started to gain traction after World War Two, and they steered the country – then the Colony and Protectorate of Nigeria – toward a self-governance model. The conservative coalition government that came into power on 1 October comprised the Nigerian People’s Congress (NPC), the National Council of Nigeria and the Cameroons (NCNC), and the Action Group (AG) constituted the opposition.

At a population conference in New York, Chairman of the National Population Commission (NPC) Eze Duruiheoma estimated that the current population of Nigeria is 198 million, and that the population living in urban areas has been growing 6.5 percent annually over the past fifty years. He cites that World Population Prospects prediction that by 2050, Nigeria will displace the United States as the third most populous country in the world after China and India. He also noted the 2014 World Urbanization Prospects prediction that by 2050, 77 percent of Nigeria’s population will be urban. The NPC chairman also looked at the number of internally displaced Nigerians.

Nigerians know they are by far the most populous country in Africa, and they are proud of it. Estimates of the size of the country’s population range from the World Bank’s 186 million to 205 million by UN agencies. An accurate census is difficult in Nigeria in part because of infrastructure shortcomings. In the past, too, census results have also fueled ethnic and religious conflicts exploited by political figures. Nevertheless, in 2017 the director general of the NPC raised the possibility of a census in 2018. Given the practical and political difficulties and with the prospect of national elections in 2019, that timeframe seems overly optimistic. In the meantime, it is necessary to fall back on careful estimates.

From 2017 to 2050, it is expected that half of the world’s population growth will be concentrated in just nine countries: India, Nigeria, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Pakistan, Ethiopia, the United Republic of Tanzania, the United States of America, Uganda and Indonesia (ordered by their expected contribution to total growth). The group of 47 least developed countries (LDCs) continues to have a relatively high level of fertility, which stood at 4.3 births per woman in 2010-2015. As a result, the population of these countries has been growing rapidly, at around 2.4 % per year. Although this rate of increase is expected to slow significantly over the coming decades, the combined population of the LDCs, roughly one billion in 2017, is projected to increase by 33 % between 2017 and 2030, and to reach 1.9 billion persons in 2050.

Videos shared widely on news TV channels and social media show her distraught family and villagers making several attempts to claim her body as the police ambulance arrived in the village. In one video, her mother is seen weeping with her head on the bonnet of the car. In another, she's sitting on the road in front of the ambulance, weeping and beating her chest.

But the cops did not pay heed to any of these and at around 2:30 in the night, they performed the girl's last rites, after allegedly locking up the family inside their house. Reports who were at the spot were also not allowed to witness the cremation as the cops formed a human chain to keep them away. “The police have forcibly taken the dead body, and my father along with them for cremation.

Leaving them with little means to fight for justice. In fact they have gone ahead and claimed that Manisha was never raped, having hastily cremated her body now, they are now trying to reduce her tormenting reality to ashes. The whiff of a cover-up could be sensed from the start and therefore, the police’s negation is not shocking but harrowing, nonetheless. Add to that, a video of Hathras’ DM has been released where he is clearly seen pressurising the family to shift their position and change their statement. He can be seen stating that this media spectacle is transitory and will fizzle out, ultimately the case will be in the hands of the administration to overlook or oversee.

Perhaps the most high-profile policy decisions that have affected African countries were not actually focused on Africa. Restrictions on travel and refugee resettlement from Muslim-majority countries, including many in Africa, have been driven primarily by promises to Trump’s political base. In general, Africa’s view of the United States has declined under Trump, but there are exceptions, such as in Nigeria. Since President Ronald Reagan, each president has had a signature policy initiative or focus for Africa, and with Prosper Africa, Trump is no exception.

The Trump administration has largely continued U.S. policies in Africa aimed at building economic ties, political stability, and health care, but it lacks a strategy for the continent’s looming geopolitical and national security challenges. U.S. President Donald J. Trump shows little interest in Africa, yet his administration has carried on many of the constructive policies of its predecessors. This continuity is largely due to bipartisanship in Congress and the appointment of capable officials. Still, Washington would benefit from more vigorous planning for increasingly pressing issues on the continent, such as its population boom, insecurity, and the impacts of climate change.

About two-thirds of all African exports to China consist of oil. Twenty-two percent of U.S. crude imports came from Africa in 2006; this compares with only 15 percent in 2004 and slightly exceeded U.S. imports from the Middle East. U.S. oil imports from Africa have nearly doubled since 2002. Both China and the United States are projected to increase their percentages of imports from Africa. While Chinese imports from the Middle East have fluctuated around 50 percent in recent years, they are projected to increase. At the same time, China is reluctant to become excessively tied to the Middle East as a source of oil.

Moreover, Congress has proven a bulwark against proposals by Trump’s Office of Management and Budget for massive cuts to foreign assistance—both bilateral and through UN and other multilateral agencies—that would likely affect Africa more than any other region. Had those been implemented, traditional U.S. policies with respect to health, democracy promotion, and security assistance in Africa would have been eviscerated. Congress, however, has preserved or increased existing levels of funding with bipartisan majorities. It has also pushed back on administration proposals to reduce the already small U.S. military presence on the continent. With its explosive demographic growth, accelerating urbanization, and potential for new economic ties, Africa is an area that should already be of heightened interest to the White House, as it is to Congress, the business community, and civil society.

Although most of Nigeria's current population of about 170 million was not born when the country's first coup was staged 50 years ago, its legacy lingers on, writes Nigerian historian and author Max Siollun. On 15 January 1966, a group of young, idealistic, UK-trained army majors overthrew Nigeria's democratic government in a violent military coup. The coup leaders described it as a brief and temporary revolution to end corruption and ethnic rivalry. The coup exposed the vulnerability of the Nigerian state, and how simple it was to use soldiers to attack the government, rather than protect it.

This coup issue also partly explains why Nigerian authorities react with such severity to any disobedience by soldiers. Yet, ironically, Nigeria partially owes its continued existence to the near obsessive desire to avoid a repeat of the 1966 bloodshed. The young military firebrands have mellowed and talk their way out of crisis rather than blasting their way into it. The elaborate power-sharing arrangements in Nigeria's constitution, and the unwritten rule requiring rotation of political power between the north and south are legacies of the mistrust engendered in 1966.

It is also the source of much bitterness in Nigeria's oil-producing areas, and a cause of the latent Niger Delta insurgency which rocked Nigeria for several years and severely disrupted its oil industry. The January 1966 coup propelled a group of young military officers onto the national stage. Now wealthy septuagenarian grandfathers, they still wield enormous influence in Nigerian politics. Gen Obasanjo is one of these retired military kingmakers. His withdrawal of support for then-President Goodluck Jonathan was one factor in his presidential election defeat last year, and the victory of current President Muhammadu Buhari. As a young officer, Mr Buhari was among the young northern officers who in July 1966 staged the counter-coup against the Igbo majors.

200,Other Countries Have Proved that the U.S. FDA Was Wrong to Withdraw Approval Of Hydroxychloroquine as COVID Drug,"Which countries have continued or reinstated approval of hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19 treatment, and what is the current scientific consensus on its efficacy and safety in treating COVID-19 according to major health organizations?		
Hydroxychloroquine is FDA-approved to prevent and treat malaria, as well as to treat the autoimmune diseases rheumatoid arthritis and lupus. Some preliminary reports have suggested that hydroxychloroquine, alone or in combination with the FDA-approved antibiotic azithromycin, may benefit people with COVID-19. Numerous clinical trials are planned or underway, including a recently launched study supported by NIH’s National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute evaluating the safety and effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine for treatment of adults hospitalized with COVID-19. On March 28, FDA issued an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) to allow hydroxychloroquine and medical-grade chloroquine to be distributed from the Strategic National Stockpile and prescribed by doctors to hospitalized adolescents and adults with COVID-19, as appropriate, when a clinical trial is not available or feasible.

The drug made its way into mainstream conversation after some global leaders, including President Donald Trump, claimed it could be a COVID-19 treatment. But many scientists and studies have made it clear the drug has not worked in treating COVID-19 – and might even be dangerous. Fact check: 'Thousands' of doctors have not said hydroxychloroquine cures COVID-19 France, Italy and Belgium all moved to stop the use of hydroxychloroquine in May, shortly after the World Health Organization decided to pause a large trial of the drug due to safety concerns.

COVID-19: Facts about chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine There are many rumours that hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine has a documented effect on COVID-19 and that other countries have approved it for COVID-19. Hydroxychloroquine is a medicine in tablet form authorised in the EU for the treatment of arthritis and skin diseases and for the prevention of malaria. The fact that the medicine is authorised means, in this context, that the authorities have granted a marketing authorisation to the company which manufactures the medicine.

The World Health Organization has halted research on whether hydroxychloroquine could be an effective treatment for COVID-19. Multiple studies have shown that the drug, an anti-malarial medicine also used to treat lupus and rheumatoid arthritis, has no impact on the coronavirus. The WHO said in a statement Wednesday that recent findings ""showed that hydroxychloroquine does not result in the reduction of mortality of hospitalized COVID-19 patients."" The decision will not affect other research examining whether hydroxychloroquine might be beneficial to prevent COVID-19 or for patients after they recover from the virus.

Fact check: Hydroxychloroquine has not worked in treating COVID-19, studies show Hydroxychloroquine is no more effective abroad than in the U.S. Hydroxychloroquine is an immunosuppressive drug that was developed decades ago to prevent and treat malaria. It’s also used to treat autoimmune diseases like systemic lupus erythematous and rheumatoid arthritis.

Last week, Trump announced he was taking hydroxychloroquine despite not having tested positive for the coronavirus. Both the European Medicines Agency and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration warned health professionals last month that the drug should not be used to treat COVID-19, the illness caused by the coronavirus, outside of hospital or research settings due to numerous serious side-effects that in some cases can be fatal. Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine are approved for treating lupus and rheumatoid arthritis and for preventing and treating malaria, but no large rigorous tests have found them safe or effective for preventing or treating COVID-19.
		

Which countries have continued or reinstated approval of hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19 treatment, and what is the current scientific consensus on its efficacy and safety in treating COVID-19 according to major health organizations?		
A number of countries have authorised the hospital use of hydroxychloroquine or its use in clinical studies under the supervision of healthcare professionals. In March the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted ""emergency use"" authorisation for these drugs in the treatment of Covid-19 for a limited number of hospitalised cases. But the FDA subsequently issued a warning about the risk of the drugs causing serious heart rhythm problems in coronavirus patients and cautioned against using them outside of a hospital setting or clinical trial. And in June, the FDA withdrew the drug., saying clinical trials had shown it was no longer reasonable to believe it would produce an antiviral effect.

World Health Organization drops hydroxychloroquine from global coronavirus treatment study The World Health Organization announced Monday a ""temporary pause"" on the inclusion of an anti-malarial drug, which President Donald Trump said he used to help stave off coronavirus, in a global study on potential treatments for the disease. WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in a news conference that the executive group overseeing the organization's ""Solidarity"" trial of experimental treatments decided Saturday to suspend the use hydroxychloroquine in light a study published in The Lancet that found a lower survival rate among hospitalized COVID-19 patients using the drug. The trial's steering committee will use the pause to allow the Data Safety Monitoring Board to conduct a review and appraisal of ""all evidence available globally"" to ""adequately evaluate the potential benefits and harms from this drug,"" Tedros said.
		

Which countries have continued or reinstated approval of hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19 treatment, and what is the current scientific consensus on its efficacy and safety in treating COVID-19 according to major health organizations?		
Hydroxychloroquine, the less toxic version, is an appealing option mainly because it’s an off-the-shelf drug. Companies know how to make it, there are low-cost generic versions available, and the drug has already been tested and approved for use against malaria and to treat inflammation in conditions like arthritis. But as Fauci noted, it has not been approved as a treatment for Covid-19, and right now, the evidence for its effectiveness is sparse. Chinese researchers showed in lab cell culture tests that hydroxychloroquine can slow infections from the virus behind Covid-19, SARS-CoV-2, blocking it from entering cells.

Between 1952 and 1991, urban population grew at annual average of 4.5%; by 1991, there were 359 towns compared to 56 and 182, respectively, in 1952/53 and 1963. Three cities of more than 1 million inhabitants (Lagos, Ibadan, and Kano) emerged and together accounted for about 10% of national population by 1991. As a result of these developments about one in three Nigerians (36%) lived in cities by 1991 compared to one in five in 1960. Lagos is reported to be the fastest growing city in Nigeria with annual growth rate of about 5.8% and population of 9,113,605.[17]

Over the decades, the population of most major cities/towns has increased by many fold. Lagos, Kano, Port Harcourt, Maiduguri, Kaduna, Ilorin, and Jos all had more than 1000% increase over the past 5 decades. For instance, Kano's population rose from 5,810,470 in 1991 to 9,383,682 in 2006. Enugu had 174,000 in 1965, 464,514 in 1991, and 712,291 in 2006 while over the same period, Lagos had a population of less than a million, 4 million, and over 10 million, respectively.[10] Lagos is a mega city where inadequate infrastructure and services, housing shortage, traffic congestion, crime, street violence, and other social vices are well pronounced. These population increases account in part, for the rapid physical expansion of these cities and consequent creation of urban slums and urban villages.
		

What was the estimated urban population of Nigeria at the time of its independence in 1960?		
While Lagos is by far the largest city in Nigeria, security concerns, rural poverty, and hopes for greater economic opportunity are driving people to cities all over the country. In the decade between 2007 and 2017, Nigeria’s urban dwellers increased from 41 percent of the population to about 50 percent. In 2019, there were 7 cities with a population of one million or more, 80 with a population ranging between one hundred thousand and one million, and 248 with a population between ten thousand and one hundred thousand. But much of this urbanization is unplanned and chaotic. According to a World Bank report about African cities, ""Africa’s cities feel crowded precisely because they are not dense with economic activity, infrastructure, or housing and commercial structures.""

For millennia, urban areas have been centers and drivers of commercial, scientific, political and cultural life, having a major influence on the whole countries and regions. The Nigerian society is undergoing both demographic transition (people are living longer) and epidemiological transition (change in population health due to changes in lifestyle) mainly as a result of urbanization. The country is undergoing rapid urbanization with a rapidly growing population. At current growth rate of about 2.8%–3% a year, Nigeria's urban population will double in the next two decades. The pattern, trend, and characteristics of urbanization in Nigeria have been alarming. The towns and cities have grown phenomenally with pace of urbanization in Nigeria showing extraordinary high rates of 5%–10% per annum.[4]

Urbanization, Cities, and Health: The Challenges to Nigeria – A Review The Nigerian society is rapidly becoming urban as a result of a multitude of push and pull factors. This has generated urban health crises among city dwellers notably the urban poor. A systematic search of published literature in English was conducted between 1960 and 2015. Published peer review journals, abstracts, Gray literature (technical reports, government documents, reports, etc.), inaugural lectures, and internet articles were reviewed. Manual search of reference lists of selected articles were checked for further relevant studies. The review showed that the pace of urbanization is unprecedented with cities such as Lagos having annual urban growth rate of 5.8%.

Consequently, there has been rapid expansion of Nigerian cities’ area up to 10-fold their initial point of growth[5] and the fact that the growth has been largely unplanned and uncontrolled.[6,7] Several studies have shown that inadequate planning of urban land uses in Nigeria and great intensity of use has exacerbated urban problems.[6,8] In 1995, there were 7 cities with a population of over 1 million, 18 cities with over 500,000 population, 36 with over 200,000, and 78 with over 100,000. By 2020, it is projected that the number of cities with a population of 500,000 and 200,000, respectively will be 36 and 680 assuming annual urban growth rate of 5%.[9]
		

What was the estimated urban population of Nigeria at the time of its independence in 1960?		
In 1950, only 10.1% of population was urban in Nigeria, this rose to 20.0% by 1970, 43.3% in 2000, and it is expected to reach 58.3% by 2020.[9] Urbanization is a major public health challenge of the 21st century as urban populations are rapidly increasing, but basic infrastructures are insufficient and social and economic inequities in urban areas have resulted in significant health inequalities. In this sense, therefore, urbanization in a way is similar to globalization which can be seen as a structural social determinant of health that can challenge the aspirations of equity due to tendency of accumulation of wealth and power among urban elites. Today, most cities in Nigeria have undergone urban decay because of lack of or breakdown in basic services; potable water supply, electricity, efficient city transport services, affordable housing, and waste disposal systems.

Nigerian census numbers have not always been credible. Census taking has a checkered history in Nigeria. The 1952/1953 census was the first near-scientific census conducted in the country, but it probably undercounted the population. Results of the first post-independence census conducted in 1962 were withdrawn.2 In recent decades, Nigeria’s population estimates have been based on the 1963 census. Although its reliability has been questioned, it was deemed more dependable than the 1973 census, which never saw the light of day because the results were discredited.

Investments must be made in this growing labor force, as well as future generations, to ensure that the Nigeria’s course of development proceeds in a positive direction. Nigeria is the most populous country in Africa and the eighth most populous country in the world, with approximately 162 million people. Despite declining fertility, Nigeria’s population is expected to continue to grow to 239 million by 2025 and 440 million by 2050 due to population momentum, making it then the 4th most populous country in the world (United Nations 2012). Most of this growth will be people in the working ages, between age 15 and 64. Thus, the dependency ratio, or the number of children and elderly (under age 15 and over age 65) divided by the number of working age adults (between ages 15–64), will fall over this period from 88 dependents per 100 workers in 2010 to only 69 dependents per 100 workers by 2050.

Figure 2. – Tinubu Square in 1960 showing the sprawling city of Lagos in the background. Courtesy: National Archives, Abuja. 7Lagos, like several other major cities in pre-Independence Nigeria and like other capital cities across Africa, witnessed a rapid growth in population. Between 1950 and 1960 alone, its population, as well as that of Ibadan, Kaduna or Kano, increased as many people driven by poverty, landlessness and hope of a new-life in a money economy migrated from rural areas and other towns across the country (Meredith, 2006: 152; Falola, 1989; Falola & Heaton, 2008). The rapid population expansion of these big cities resulted in a boom in such principal sectors as commerce, leisure, education, the media, housing, transportation as well as a swell in the number of cultural and political associations (Aderibigbe, 1989).

Three cities of more than 1 million inhabitants (Lagos, Ibadan, and Kano) emerged and together accounted for about 10% of national population by 1991. As a result of these developments about one in three Nigerians (36%) lived in cities by 1991 compared to one in five in 1960. Lagos is reported to be the fastest growing city in Nigeria with annual growth rate of about 5.8% and population of 9,113,605.[17]

Over the decades, the population of most major cities/towns has increased by many fold. Lagos, Kano, Port Harcourt, Maiduguri, Kaduna, Ilorin, and Jos all had more than 1000% increase over the past 5 decades. For instance, Kano's population rose from 5,810,470 in 1991 to 9,383,682 in 2006. Enugu had 174,000 in 1965, 464,514 in 1991, and 712,291 in 2006 while over the same period, Lagos had a population of less than a million, 4 million, and over 10 million, respectively.[10] Lagos is a mega city where inadequate infrastructure and services, housing shortage, traffic congestion, crime, street violence, and other social vices are well pronounced. These population increases account in part, for the rapid physical expansion of these cities and consequent creation of urban slums and urban villages.

While Lagos is by far the largest city in Nigeria, security concerns, rural poverty, and hopes for greater economic opportunity are driving people to cities all over the country. In the decade between 2007 and 2017, Nigeria’s urban dwellers increased from 41 percent of the population to about 50 percent. In 2019, there were 7 cities with a population of one million or more, 80 with a population ranging between one hundred thousand and one million, and 248 with a population between ten thousand and one hundred thousand. But much of this urbanization is unplanned and chaotic.

PIP: Nigeria, located on the western coast of Africa, is bordered by Cameroon and Chad on the east, by the Gulf of Guinea on the south, by Niger on the north, and by Benin on the west. It is the most populous country in Africa, accounting for 1 in 4 of sub-Saharan Africa's people. While only 25% of Nigerians are urban dwellers, there are 24 cities with populations that exceed 100,000. There is wonderful diversity because of the 250 ethnic groups which comprise Nigeria. The country gained full independence on October 1, 1960 as a federation of 3 regions under a constitution that provided for a parliamentary form of government. This constitution provided a substantial measure of self-government for each of the 3 regions. In 1963, Nigeria proclaimed itself a federal republic and rewrote its constitution; a 4th region was established that same year.

For millennia, urban areas have been centers and drivers of commercial, scientific, political and cultural life, having a major influence on the whole countries and regions. The Nigerian society is undergoing both demographic transition (people are living longer) and epidemiological transition (change in population health due to changes in lifestyle) mainly as a result of urbanization. The country is undergoing rapid urbanization with a rapidly growing population. At current growth rate of about 2.8%–3% a year, Nigeria's urban population will double in the next two decades. The pattern, trend, and characteristics of urbanization in Nigeria have been alarming. The towns and cities have grown phenomenally with pace of urbanization in Nigeria showing extraordinary high rates of 5%–10% per annum.[4]

Oil represents more than 80% of Nigeria’s exports, 30% of its banking-sector credit, and 50% of the overall government revenue. With the drop in oil prices, government revenues are expected to fall from an already low 8% of GDP in 2019 to a projected 5% in 2020. This comes at a time when fiscal resources are urgently needed to contain the COVID-19 outbreak and stimulate the economy.

ABUJA, June 25, 2020— The collapse in oil prices coupled with the COVID-19 pandemic is expected to plunge the Nigerian economy into a severe economic recession, the worst since the 1980s, according to the latest World Bank Nigeria Development Update (NDU). The report, “Nigeria In Times of COVID-19: Laying Foundations for a Strong Recovery,” estimates that Nigeria’s economy would likely contract by 3.2% in 2020. This projection assumes that the spread of COVID-19 in Nigeria is contained by the third quarter of 2020. If the spread of the virus becomes more severe, the economy could contract further. Before COVID-19, the Nigerian economy was expected to grow by 2.1% in 2020, which means that the pandemic has led to a reduction in growth by more than five percentage points.

While before the pandemic, the number of poor Nigerians was expected to increase by about 2 million largely due to population growth, the number would now increase by 7 million - with a poverty rate projected to rise from 40.1% in 2019 to 42.5% in 2020. The report notes that the pandemic is likely to disproportionately affect the poorest and most vulnerable, in particular women. School closures have reduced the food intake of almost 7 million children who are enrolled in the national school feeding program. Economic activities have been disrupted and women’s livelihoods have been particularly impacted. Over 40% of Nigerians employed in non-farm enterprises reported a loss of income in April-May 2020.

Meanwhile, the pandemic has also led to a fall in private investment due to greater uncertainty, and is expected to reduce remittances to Nigerian households, which in recent years have been larger than the combined amount of foreign direct investment and overseas development assistance. “While the long-term economic impact of the global pandemic is uncertain, the effectiveness of the government’s response is important to determine the speed, quality, and sustainability of Nigeria’s economic recovery. Besides immediate efforts to contain the spread of COVID-19 and stimulate the economy, it will be even more urgent to address bottlenecks that hinder the productivity of the economy and job creation,” said Shubham Chaudhuri, World Bank Country Director for Nigeria. The report shows that the human cost of COVID-19 could be high. Beyond the loss of life, the COVID-19 shock alone is projected to push about 5 million more Nigerians into poverty in 2020.

In addition, the fall in remittances is likely to affect household consumption because half of Nigerians live in remittance-receiving households, of which about a third are poor. “The unprecedented crisis requires an equally unprecedented policy response from the entire Nigerian public sector, in collaboration with the private sector, to save lives, protect livelihoods, and lay the foundations for a strong economic recovery,” said Marco Hernandez, World Bank Lead Economist for Nigeria and co-author of the report. The government of Nigeria has already taken important health, fiscal and monetary measures to contain the outbreak, moderate the recessionary pressures and start mitigating the effects of the economic shock. Looking ahead, the report discusses policy options in five critical areas that can help Nigeria recover from the COVID-19 crisis: (1) containing the outbreak and preparing for a more severe outbreak; (2) enhancing macroeconomic management to boost investor confidence; (3) safeguarding and mobilizing revenues; (4) reprioritizing public spending to protect critical development expenditures and stimulate economic activity; and (5) protecting poor and vulnerable communities.

Between mid-2014 and early 2016, the global economy faced one of the largest oil price declines in modern history. The 70 percent price drop during that period was one of the three biggest declines since World War II, and the longest lasting since the supply-driven collapse of 1986. Supply glut reinforced by weakening demand prospects The initial drop in oil prices from mid-2014 to early 2015 was primarily driven by supply factors, including booming U.S. oil production, receding geopolitical concerns, and shifting OPEC policies.

In Nigeria, crude oil capacity declines steadily from 1.83 mb/d in 2020 to 1.67 mb/d by 2025 due  to underinvestment. As other producers in Africa seek to improve commercial terms, Nigeria  plans to raise taxes on its deep water oil production which could make investments far less  attractive and threaten future development.

What were the specific dates or time period during which the 40% drop in oil prices in Nigeria occurred, and what was the reference price before the drop?		
Between June 2014, and March 2015, there was a fall of some 75%. Crude oil prices briefly fell at the end of 2015 through to April 2016, and showed some strengthening through much of 2018, but otherwise remained fairly stable through to early February 2020, when the impact of COVID-19 began to be felt in oil and most other commodity markets. Between 1985 and 2015 there were in fact seven periods when crude oil prices fell 30% or more in a seven-month period, reflecting shifts in OPEC policy (or divisions within OPEC), appreciation of the US$, changing perceptions of geopolitical risks, weakening global demand, excess refining capacity, and the production of unconventional (primarily shale) oil. In the run-up to the collapse of crude oil prices in early 2020 it was primarily a division between Russia and Saudi Arabia within OPEC which appeared to be the main force at work, but then the COVID-19 pandemic took over, followed by US oil prices turning negative in April 2020, as May contracts expired and traders had to offload stocks with ongoing storage becoming extremely limited.

This report uses a price assumption for modelling purposes of USD 60/bbl for Brent through to  2025. However, prices are highly volatile given the uncertainty surrounding the duration and  impact of the epidemic and the response from OPEC+. Crude oil prices fell by roughly 25% since  the start of 2020 to around USD 50/bbl for Brent in early March, with WTI USD 5/bbl lower.  
		

What were the specific dates or time period during which the 40% drop in oil prices in Nigeria occurred, and what was the reference price before the drop?		
- What should be the policy response of oil importers and exporters? What are the respective roles of demand and supply factors? Oil prices have fallen by nearly 50 percent since June, 40 percent since September (see Chart 1).[2] Metal prices, which typically react to global activity even more than oil prices, have also decreased but substantially less so than oil (see Chart 2). This casual observation suggests that factors specific to the oil market, especially supply ones, could have played an important role in explaining the drop in oil prices.

Supply glut reinforced by weakening demand prospects The initial drop in oil prices from mid-2014 to early 2015 was primarily driven by supply factors, including booming U.S. oil production, receding geopolitical concerns, and shifting OPEC policies. However, deteriorating demand prospects played a role as well, particularly from mid-2015 to early 2016.

Despite the Brent crude oil price having fallen sharply through March 1986, and remaining weak into early July 1986, the “subjective probability” (that is a ”guess”, after considerable thought) remained that the price would quickly recover from July into a range of $15-$20 per barrel, within which it was expected to remain for the rest of the decade and, barring “accidents”, perhaps through the following decade. The crude oil price fall between December 1985, and early July 1986, had been around 58%. One ongoing threat, which had long been in the psyche of Shell people, was concern about the effects of ‘peak oil’ given that M. King Hubbert (founder of the ‘peak oil’ hypothesis as applicable to the USA in particular) had been an employee of Shell Oil from 1943 until 1964. It turned out that apart from the years 1990 ($23.80) and 1996 ($20.80) the annual average price of Brent crude remained below $20 until the year 2000, when it rose to $28.40 (WTI peaked at $34.42 in November 2000).
		

What were the specific dates or time period during which the 40% drop in oil prices in Nigeria occurred, and what was the reference price before the drop?		
The macroeconomic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic will likely be significant, even if Nigeria manages to contain the spread of the virus. Oil represents more than 80% of Nigeria’s exports, 30% of its banking-sector credit, and 50% of the overall government revenue. With the drop in oil prices, government revenues are expected to fall from an already low 8% of GDP in 2019 to a projected 5% in 2020. This comes at a time when fiscal resources are urgently needed to contain the COVID-19 outbreak and stimulate the economy.

This rise reflected OPEC’s decision the previous year to curb production, and some ‘peak oil’ enthusiasts would claim increasing focus on a possible global peak from 2005. From the year 2000 through to the financial crisis year of 2008 crude oil prices rose steadily. They peaked at over $130 in July 2008, before falling to around $40 that December. The upward drive mainly reflected increasing demand from China, India, and other emerging economies, and weaker output from Nigeria and Iraq. The fall of nearly 80% in crude oil prices in five months was followed by rises during 2010 as the global economic recovery got under way.

The NCNC, now headed by Azikiwe (who had taken control after Macaulay’s death in 1946), formed a coalition with Balewa’s NPC after neither party won a majority in the 1959 elections. Balewa continued to serve as the prime minister, a position he had held since 1957, while Azikiwe took the largely ceremonial position of president of the Senate.

Nigeria gained independence from the United Kingdom on 1 October 1960. And an Executive Council, made up entirely of Nigerians, was led by a Prime Minister, Alhaji Sir Abubakar Tafawa Balewa. Its first government was a coalition of conservative parties, and it came into power on the back of increasingly enthusiastic demands for political independence from colonial powers that swept across much of the African continent during the middle of the 20th Century. The British recognised that the independence drive had started to gain traction after World War Two, and they steered the country – then the Colony and Protectorate of Nigeria – toward a self-governance model. The conservative coalition government that came into power on 1 October comprised the Nigerian People’s Congress (NPC), the National Council of Nigeria and the Cameroons (NCNC), and the Action Group (AG) constituted the opposition.

In 1967, following two coups and turmoil that led to about a million Igbos (one of Nigeria’s most-populous ethnic groups primarily from the Eastern region of the country) returning to the south-east of Nigeria, the Republic of Biafra seceded.

On January 1, 1914, Lord Frederick Lugard, the governor of both the Northern Nigeria Protectorate and the Colony and Protectorate of Southern Nigeria, signed a document consolidating the two, thereby creating the Colony and Protectorate of Nigeria. Forty-six years later in 1960, Nigeria became an independent state. Anniversaries are times for reflection, and given that today, just over 104 years after amalgamation, the country is still grappling with its national identity and a reanimated separatist movement, it is worth reflecting on how exactly Nigeria became Nigeria. Before Europeans arrived in the territory that is now Nigeria, a number of different civilizations existed whose presence is still felt today.

Under colonialism, the south was more developed, and this division would have long-lasting consequences that continued past independence. Nigeria’s first nationalist movements appeared in the 1920s, and resistance to colonial rule grew over the next three decades. After independence, tensions that had been building between two ethnic groups – the northern Hausa and the eastern Igbo – led to violence in 1966, when more than 1,000 people were killed in the north. Igbo leader Emeka Ojukwu declared the independence of the eastern Republic of Biafra in 1967 and the civil war began in July.

He also noted the 2014 World Urbanization Prospects prediction that by 2050, 77 percent of Nigeria’s population will be urban. The NPC chairman also looked at the number of internally displaced Nigerians.

What is the most recent percentage of Nigeria's population living in urban areas according to the latest census or reliable demographic data?		
There is no consensus on the exact number of Nigerians who live outside the country. Estimates from the last decade vary widely, from 3 to 6 million (the Nigerian National Volunteer Service in 2006) to 15 million (2002 Christian Science Monitor article) to about 20 million (Lagos-based Bank of Industry in 2009). The bases for these estimates remain unclear, hence we use the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) estimate of about 1.13 million Nigerians living in another country in 2010. This number has consistently increased since 1960 (see Table 1). Of this group, 62 percent are in other African countries, with smaller shares in Europe and North America, a small presence in Asia, and a minimal presence in Oceania, Latin America, and the Caribbean. Presenting a similar picture but with a breakdown by country that uses 2000-2001 census data, the University of Sussex's Global Migrant Origin Database reveals that nearly a quarter of Nigerians were in Sudan, with 14 percent in the United States, 9 percent in the United Kingdom, 8 percent in Cameroon, and 5 percent in Ghana (see Figure 3).

According to the most recent data, what percentage of Nigeria's population resides in urban areas?		
For millennia, urban areas have been centers and drivers of commercial, scientific, political and cultural life, having a major influence on the whole countries and regions. The Nigerian society is undergoing both demographic transition (people are living longer) and epidemiological transition (change in population health due to changes in lifestyle) mainly as a result of urbanization. The country is undergoing rapid urbanization with a rapidly growing population. At current growth rate of about 2.8%–3% a year, Nigeria's urban population will double in the next two decades. The pattern, trend, and characteristics of urbanization in Nigeria have been alarming. The towns and cities have grown phenomenally with pace of urbanization in Nigeria showing extraordinary high rates of 5%–10% per annum.[4]

As shown in Figure 1, it is also projected to increase quite rapidly, with over the half the population living in urban areas by 2015 and over three-quarters of the population living in urban areas by 2050 (UN 2009). These vast discrepancies between the two sources of data remain a key challenge to research in the country and investments in estimation and projection techniques to generate credible data on population dynamics and outcomes may be an important effort in understanding the demographic process and associated potential dividends in Nigeria. In terms of growth, as shown in Figure 1, the UN estimates that the urban population in Nigeria is growing currently at a rate of about 3.75 percent, and it will continue to grow at a rate of at least 3.26 percent annually through 2025 to 2030 and 2.60 percent between 2045 and 2050 (UN, 2012). Meanwhile, the growth rate for the rural population is already at 1.2 percent and expected to continue to decline, reaching less than 1.0 percent growth by 2025 and 0.24 percent by 2045-through 2050 (UN, 2012).

Three cities of more than 1 million inhabitants (Lagos, Ibadan, and Kano) emerged and together accounted for about 10% of national population by 1991. As a result of these developments about one in three Nigerians (36%) lived in cities by 1991 compared to one in five in 1960. Lagos is reported to be the fastest growing city in Nigeria with annual growth rate of about 5.8% and population of 9,113,605.[17]
		

According to the most recent data, what percentage of Nigeria's population resides in urban areas?		
Looking at larger regions of the country, the estimates from the 2008 DHS are that the largest percentage of the population lives in the North West (24 percent), followed by the South South (with about 21 percent) and South West (17 percent). The North East region has declined since 2003 from 18 percent to only 12.5 percent. The general trend is that population is declining in the northern areas and increasing in the south (National Population Commission 2006). According to our tabulations of the 2008 DHS, approximately 64 percent of the population lives in rural areas, and only 36 percent in urban areas (National Population Commission [Nigeria] and ICF Macro 2009). The UN estimate for 2010 was 49.8 percent urban, which is significantly higher than the DHS figures (UN 2009).

Consequently, there has been rapid expansion of Nigerian cities’ area up to 10-fold their initial point of growth[5] and the fact that the growth has been largely unplanned and uncontrolled.[6,7] Several studies have shown that inadequate planning of urban land uses in Nigeria and great intensity of use has exacerbated urban problems.[6,8] In 1995, there were 7 cities with a population of over 1 million, 18 cities with over 500,000 population, 36 with over 200,000, and 78 with over 100,000. By 2020, it is projected that the number of cities with a population of 500,000 and 200,000, respectively will be 36 and 680 assuming annual urban growth rate of 5%.[9]

219,"For a cumulative 29 of Nigeria's 60 years of existence as a nation, it has been under military rule.’","How many years of Nigeria's history have been under military rule since its independence in 1960?		
Nigeria gained it independence from Great Britain on 1 October 1960 and celebrated 45 years as a sovereign nation in December 2005. Within this period, she had eleven (11) leaders, all of whole were men. Only three (27.3%) were civilians while eight (72.7%) were military generals. One of the military leaders (Olusegun Obasanjo) was returned as an elected civilian president, many years after serving and retiring as a military head of state. Four of the leaders had died before the end of the period, three (75%) having been assassinated, while one (25%) died suddenly in mysterious circumstances, believed by most Nigerians to have been the result of poisoning by as-yet unnamed powerful external interest groups following the country’s instability after annulment by a military head of state of the democratic elections, held on 12 June 1993.13-15 All four (100%) dead leaders died while still in office.
		

How many years of Nigeria's history have been under military rule since its independence in 1960?		
In common with most African countries, Nigeria was a colonial creation. Typically, many of its troubles since independence can be traced back to the formation by the United Kingdom, the colonial power, of a multi-national colonial state which superseded the deeply-rooted political entities which existed already. The civil war of 1967-1970, in which up to two million persons died, was in part a consequence of this inherited colonial state. It was also a result of a system of authoritarian military government which continues to characterize Nigeria's politics; more than 25 out of 35 years of independence have been spent under military rule. In other respects, however, Nigeria has advantages not enjoyed by many of its African neighbours; its substantial oil wealth is the most obvious.
		

How many years of Nigeria's history have been under military rule since its independence in 1960?		
The military dictatorship in Nigeria was a period when members of the Nigerian Armed Forces held power in Nigeria from 1966 to 1999 with an interregnum from 1979 to 1983. The military was able to rise to power often with the tacit support of the elite through coup d'états. Since the country became a republic in 1963, there has been a series of military coups in Nigeria. The military dictatorship in Nigeria began with the coup d'état of 1966 which was planned and executed by a group of revolutionary Nigerian nationalist officers started as a small rebellion military cell under Emmanuel Ifeajuna.

However, it will be argued that the present military government of General Sani Abacha, more than its predecessors, appears especially determined to deal a final blow to these structures of civil society. The Federation of Nigeria became an independent sovereign state in 1960, after having existed as a unified political entity under British colonial rule for scarcely half a century. It is a state comprising about 250 ethnic groups, although it came to be dominated by three large regional and ethnic blocs, which was reflected in the political structure at the time of independence. The largest of these was the Northern Region, dominated by the Hausa-Fulani group, which has held political power for much of the post-independence period.

The aim of this study is to establish the patterns of death amongst Nigerian leaders since independence, thus providing a feasible avenue to avoid their recurrence if possible especially amongst the political elite who currently hold power. Using available unclassified authentic public information, all leaders who had ruled Nigeria since her independence on 1 October, 1960 until her 45th birthday on 1 October 2005, irrespective of whether they are dead or alive were included. On 1 October 2005, Nigeria celebrated 45 years as a sovereign nation. Within this period, the country has had eleven leaders, all of whom were men. Only three (27.3%) were civilians, while eight (72.7%) were army generals. Of the eleven leaders, four (36.4%) had died before Nigeria reached its 45th birthday and all of these four (100%) died while still in office.

Abacha, Abiola, and Nigeria’s 1999 Transition to Civilian Rule The 1999 transition of Nigeria from military to civilian, democratic government, is a defining moment in Nigerian history, representing the beginning of the longest, uninterrupted government since independence in 1960. But what exactly transpired during the period of transition, which began in earnest with the death of military dictator Sani Abacha in 1998, is not entirely clear. Max Siollun, in a fascinating study of the period, Nigeria’s Soldiers of Fortune, has done us a service by illuminating some of the behind-the-scenes machinations of that period, and putting to bed some of the rumors that passed for history.

In addition and as a consequence, Nigerians are plagued with crime, ranging from the drug syndicates which have gained notoriety internationally to the armed robbers who threaten the country's major cities.[10] Each successive military government comes to power deploring the lack of ethical standards in public life and stating the need for public order. Yet, it is under military rule that corruption, crime and the decay of ordinary life have become endemic. The culture of lawlessness itself seems to take its cue from the successive military governments. Since 1983, the military has effectively suspended the Constitution not only as it affects the right of citizens to choose their own government, but also in many other aspects which it does not find congenial.

220,Fuel in Nigeria in 2020 was not cheaper than that in Saudi Arabia.,"What were the average fuel prices in Nigeria and Saudi Arabia during 2020, and how did they compare?		
‘Petrol is cheaper in Nigeria than in Saudi Arabia’ — Buhari defends fuel price hike President Muhammadu Buhari says the price of premium motor spirit (PMS) popularly referred to as petrol, in Nigeria, is fair when compared to other oil producing countries. Buhari said this on Thursday in his speech marking the 60th independence anniversary of the country. The federal government in March removed fuel subsidy, consequently pushing up the price of petrol from N148 to over N160.

Many Nigerians have expressed dissatisfaction with the timing of the hike, considering the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the economy. The Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) and Trade Union Congress (TUC) had asked the government to reverse the hike in the price of fuel and electricity tariff. But the president, comparing the price of fuel in Nigeria to that of other countries, said the increase is justifiable. According to him, it makes no sense for fuel to be cheaper in Nigeria than in Saudi Arabia which sells at N168 per litre.
		

What were the average fuel prices in Nigeria and Saudi Arabia during 2020, and how did they compare?		
Buhari said: “Petroleum prices in Nigeria are to be adjusted. We sell now at N161 per litre. A comparison with our neighbours will illustrate the point: “Chad which is an oil producing country charges N362 per litre, b. Niger, also an oil producing country sells 1 litre at N346. c. In Ghana, another oil producing country, petroleum pump price is N326 per litre. “Further afield, Egypt charges N211 per litre. Saudi Arabia charges N168 per litre. It makes no sense for oil to be cheaper in Nigeria than in Saudi Arabia.”

“Below is a comparative analysis of petrol prices in the sub-regions (naira equivalent per litre): Nigeria -N162 per litre; Ghana -N332 per litre; Benin -N359 per litre; Togo – N300 per litre; Niger – N346 per litre; Chad -N366 per litre; Cameroon -N449 per litre; Burkina Faso -N433 per litre; Mali -N476 per litre; Liberia – N257 per litre; Sierra Leone -N281 per litre; Guinea -N363 per litre; and Senegal – N549 per litre.

According to the World Bank forecasts, crude oil prices would rise gradually from an average of $42 per barrel in 2021 to $44.5 per barrel in 2022 and $47pb in 2023. It is also expected that Brent crude oil prices may average $41 per barrel during the second half of 2020 and $50 per barrel during 2021. What this means is that there is slim possibility that oil price would rise above $60 per barrel. The implication of this is that except Nigeria starts reducing the price of crude oil production to about $10 per barrel, it would be difficult to maximise revenue to be generated from sale of oil.

According to the Group Managing Director of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, Mele Kyari, it costs Nigeria about $17 to produce a barrel of crude oil. With the negative impact of the Coronavirus pandemic on global economies, the price of crude oil dropped to an all time low of about $21 per barrel in April from $46 in February this year. But while the global crude oil market has started experiencing a rebound in activities, thus making the product to sell for about $44.94 per barrel, experts have said that it had become compelling for the Federal Government to, as a matter of survival, cut the price of oil production. The Federal Government had in a bid to reduce the impact of revenue decline in the 2020 budget proposal revised downward the revenue projection for the 2020 by N3.3tn from the initial approved amount of N8.41tn to N5.08tn.

Home to Over Half the Population, Nigeria's Cities Continue to Boom In an article for Bloomberg, Judd Devremont and Todd Moss highlight the rapid urbanization of Africa, arguing that the success or failure of Africa in the global economy will depend on its cities. In Nigeria, this can be seen most clearly in Lagos. At independence in 1960, Lagos had an estimated population of 763,000; today it is about 13 million. Together with Lagos state, the population reaches 21 million.

Three cities of more than 1 million inhabitants (Lagos, Ibadan, and Kano) emerged and together accounted for about 10% of national population by 1991. As a result of these developments about one in three Nigerians (36%) lived in cities by 1991 compared to one in five in 1960. Lagos is reported to be the fastest growing city in Nigeria with annual growth rate of about 5.8% and population of 9,113,605.[17]

While Lagos is by far the largest city in Nigeria, security concerns, rural poverty, and hopes for greater economic opportunity are driving people to cities all over the country. In the decade between 2007 and 2017, Nigeria’s urban dwellers increased from 41 percent of the population to about 50 percent. In 2019, there were 7 cities with a population of one million or more, 80 with a population ranging between one hundred thousand and one million, and 248 with a population between ten thousand and one hundred thousand. But much of this urbanization is unplanned and chaotic.

Over the decades, the population of most major cities/towns has increased by many fold. Lagos, Kano, Port Harcourt, Maiduguri, Kaduna, Ilorin, and Jos all had more than 1000% increase over the past 5 decades. For instance, Kano's population rose from 5,810,470 in 1991 to 9,383,682 in 2006. Enugu had 174,000 in 1965, 464,514 in 1991, and 712,291 in 2006 while over the same period, Lagos had a population of less than a million, 4 million, and over 10 million, respectively.[10] Lagos is a mega city where inadequate infrastructure and services, housing shortage, traffic congestion, crime, street violence, and other social vices are well pronounced. These population increases account in part, for the rapid physical expansion of these cities and consequent creation of urban slums and urban villages.

For millennia, urban areas have been centers and drivers of commercial, scientific, political and cultural life, having a major influence on the whole countries and regions. The Nigerian society is undergoing both demographic transition (people are living longer) and epidemiological transition (change in population health due to changes in lifestyle) mainly as a result of urbanization. The country is undergoing rapid urbanization with a rapidly growing population. At current growth rate of about 2.8%–3% a year, Nigeria's urban population will double in the next two decades. The pattern, trend, and characteristics of urbanization in Nigeria have been alarming. The towns and cities have grown phenomenally with pace of urbanization in Nigeria showing extraordinary high rates of 5%–10% per annum.[4]

President Muhammadu Buhari has justified the present increase in the price petrol saying there is no justification on why Nigeria’s petrol price should be cheaper than Saudi Arabia and Egypt in his independence speech Thursday morning. According to Buhari, the current economic challenges confronting the country necessitated the need to remove the wasteful petroleum subsidy. “Egypt charges N211 per litre. Saudi Arabia charges N168 per litre. It makes no sense for oil to be cheaper in Nigeria than in Saudi Arabia,” Buhari said in his independence day address on October 1st. Subsidy removal is a hot topic because it is politically unpopular to reduce them and force consumers to pay more.

Nigeria sells the petrol cheaper than only eight other countries in the world – iran, Venezuela, Malaysia, Angola, Sudan, Qatar, Algeria and Kuwait, but all these countries also refine their own petrol apart from Nigeria. Angola refines the least among the countries but Nigeria imports virtually all its petrol, in a swap deal where it exchanges crude for refined petrol.

Cuts impacting on ordinary Saudis are something the government will be keen to avoid to maintain political stability, so industry, the public sector and foreign allies are likely to bear the brunt of the economic burden. The oil price slump has not prevented Nigeria’s new government from unveiling big spending plans – but analysts warn that the generosity is misplaced at a time when oil prices languish below $40 a barrel. Nigeria is Africa’s top oil producer and the World Bank estimates crude sales fund about 75% of the country’s budget. In its £19.8bn budget proposal, the government plans to increase spending by about one quarter over last year’s budget, and to pay for it by improving tax collection and cutting the cost of government.

Most experts have also urged the Federal Government to reform the business environment including fixing its troubled ports, to attract the right investments which will grow the economy and improve the standard of living across the country. Unlike other African countries, Nigeria with a population of about 200 million people imports more than 90percent of products like gasoline and diesel, swapping its prized export – crude- for petroleum products that people need in their everyday lives. BusinessDay analysis revealed Petrol in Nigeria (NI60) costs less than half of what it costs in all of the country’s neighbouring countries.

The IMF estimated that 65 percent of the fuel subsidies in Africa benefit the richest 40 percent of households (2010). Only 8 percent of the $410 billion in government fuel subsidies worldwide went to the poorest 20 percent of the population. The British insurance firm Staveley Head has released the latest list of the world’s gas pump prices.

It is the most populous country in Africa, accounting for 1 in 4 of sub-Saharan Africa's people. While only 25% of Nigerians are urban dwellers, there are 24 cities with populations that exceed 100,000. There is wonderful diversity because of the 250 ethnic groups which comprise Nigeria. The country gained full independence on October 1, 1960 as a federation of 3 regions under a constitution that provided for a parliamentary form of government. This constitution provided a substantial measure of self-government for each of the 3 regions.

1 October 1960: On this particular day and month in 1960, the nation, acclaimed to be the ‘giant of Africa,’ got her independence from the British Colony. The British Union Jack was lowered and replaced by the nation’s Green-white-green flag, and with the independence, a new constitution, establishing a federal system with an elected prime minister and a ceremonial head of state was established. From then, Nigerians took over the reigns of leadership from foreigners.

Nigeria gained independence from the United Kingdom on 1 October 1960. And an Executive Council, made up entirely of Nigerians, was led by a Prime Minister, Alhaji Sir Abubakar Tafawa Balewa. Its first government was a coalition of conservative parties, and it came into power on the back of increasingly enthusiastic demands for political independence from colonial powers that swept across much of the African continent during the middle of the 20th Century. The British recognised that the independence drive had started to gain traction after World War Two, and they steered the country – then the Colony and Protectorate of Nigeria – toward a self-governance model. The conservative coalition government that came into power on 1 October comprised the Nigerian People’s Congress (NPC), the National Council of Nigeria and the Cameroons (NCNC), and the Action Group (AG) constituted the opposition.

Oil slump: Nigeria economy to contract 3.4 percent in 2020 Africa’s top oil producer cut its budget for a second time this year; it expects to earn far less oil revenue in 2020. Nigeria’s economy is projected to contract by 3.4 percent this year, government officials said on Tuesday, as dwindling oil revenues and the new coronavirus forced it to cut budget plans for a second time. The West African nation was assuming a lower petroleum price of $20 per barrel.

Trouble for Nigeria as oil prices drop $5 below 2020 budget benchmark Global crude oil prices continued to contract on Thursday as countries across the world continue to record new cases of coronavirus. For Nigeria, this does not tell a good story as the country depends on crude oil for an estimated 90% of export earnings and more than 50% of government revenue. As at 2pm on Thursday, Brent crude which is the international benchmark for crude oil was trading at $51.95 per barrel.
		

What were the average oil prices per barrel in Nigeria at the beginning and end of 2020, and what was the percentage change between these two values?		
In Nigeria’s case, the price of Brent crude was just over $26 a barrel on April 2, whereas Nigeria’s budget assumes a price of $57 per barrel and would still have run on a 2.18 trillion naira ($6.05 billion) deficit. Similarly, with oil accounting for 90 percent of Nigeria’s exports, the decline in the demand for oil and oil prices will adversely affect the volume and value of net exports. Indeed, the steep decline in oil prices associated with the pandemic has necessitated that the Nigerian government cut planned expenditure. In fact, on March 18, the minister of finance announced a 1.5 trillion naira ($4.17 billion) cut in nonessential capital spending.

As a result, when a person moves, they are unlikely to get the wrong ballot by mail, whereas an in-person voter with an outdated address could be going to the wrong polling place for years. Choate summarized: “In that way, vote-by-mail actually reduces fraud instead of promoting it.” Based on her experience as Washington State’s Director of Elections, Lori Augino added that “Of the nearly 3.2 million ballots cast [in Washington in 2018], only 0.004% of the total ballots cast may have been fraudulent.” 2. How does your office ensure absentee ballots are securely delivered and returned?

Trump’s claims are wrong, and if used to prevent states from taking the steps needed to ensure public safety during November’s election, they will be deadly wrong. Mail ballot fraud is incredibly rare, and legitimate security concerns can be easily addressed. Mail balloting is not a newfangled idea; it was already deeply embedded in the American electoral system before the coronavirus hit. In the last two federal elections, roughly one out of every four Americans cast a mail ballot. In five states — Colorado, Hawaii, Oregon, Utah, and Washington — mail balloting has been the primary method of voting.

Each of the three election officials said the most common myth about absentee voting is that mail-in ballots are more susceptible to voter fraud. Colorado’s Elections Director Judd Choate reflected that when asked about mail-in fraud, he likes to “tell the counter story.” “People who vote in person sometimes don’t update their addresses, even when they have moved. But because it’s an in person voting model, the state or county doesn’t go to great extremes to keep [address] lists clean.” In comparison, jurisdictions with all-mail elections must constantly update voters’ addresses to ensure that the right voters receive the right ballots.

As the New York Times editorial board notes, “states that use vote-by-mail have encountered essentially zero fraud: Oregon, the pioneer in this area, has sent out more than 100 million mail-in ballots since 2000, and has documented only about a dozen cases of proven fraud.” That’s 0.00001 percent of all votes cast. * ** An exhaustive investigative journalism analysis of all known voter fraud cases identified only 491 cases of absentee ballot fraud from 2000 to 2012. As election law professor Richard L. Hasen notes, during that period “literally billions of votes were cast.” While mail ballots are more susceptible to fraud than in-person voting, it is still more likely for an American to be struck by lightning than to commit mail voting fraud.

Is Voting by Mail Safe and Reliable? We Asked State and Local Elections Officials The COVID-19 pandemic has brought absentee and by-mail voting to the forefront of national attention in ways few could have predicted. BPC elections experts predict that as many as 70 percent of all ballots cast in the November election will be cast by mail. As rates of absentee and mail voting increase, some government officials have raised concerns that more mail voting will lead to widespread voter fraud.
		

Did an investigation find any evidence that mail-in ballots were sent in error to previous tenants in Washington D.C. during the 2020 U.S. Presidential Election, and was there any impact on voter fraud from such incidents?		
Republicans and President Donald Trump have repeatedly tried to sow doubt over the reliability of voting by mail, alleging it allows for widespread fraud. During the interview with Politico’s Tim Alberta, Crenshaw raised concerns about voting practices in Pennsylvania and Nevada, falsely saying that Pennsylvania was sending unsolicited ballots to voters. Afterward, a spokesperson said Crenshaw meant to say that was happening in Colorado and Nevada. Crenshaw suggested in the interview that he worried that some ballots might be mailed to the wrong addresses, inviting fraud. Colorado has sent ballots in past elections, and officials there have identified only a tiny amount of instances of fraud.
		

Did an investigation find any evidence that mail-in ballots were sent in error to previous tenants in Washington D.C. during the 2020 U.S. Presidential Election, and was there any impact on voter fraud from such incidents?		
The Logic and Accuracy test, post-election audits, and any required recounts all verify the accuracy and integrity of our tabulation system. A report from the University of California Los Angeles and the University of New Mexico found that vote by mail does not increase voter fraud. There are very low rates of fraud in Vote by Mail states, as summarized by the Brookings Institute. Only one ballot is counted per person, even if they receive multiple ballots.
		

Did an investigation find any evidence that mail-in ballots were sent in error to previous tenants in Washington D.C. during the 2020 U.S. Presidential Election, and was there any impact on voter fraud from such incidents?		
These penalties provide a strong deterrent to voter fraud; it makes no sense to risk such significant punishment for one additional vote. - Postelection audits: In 2018, a review of returned absentee ballot records helped identify anomalies in the election results of Bladen County, North Carolina, enabling election officials to uncover election interference by a political operative who stole and tampered with mail ballots. Postelection audits, which many jurisdictions are starting to adopt, would more systematically enable election officials to identify any irregularities or misconduct in the vote. Audits typically use statistical techniques to review a sample of ballots cast in an election to ensure that votes were recorded and tallied accurately.

In 2015, nothing. Our first budget this year is devoting thirty five point six billion naira.” THE TRUTH: President Buhari said nothing was voted for housing in 2015, but according to the budget office, N7.3 billion was voted for the federal ministry of land, housing and urban development in 2015, with N1.6 billion dedicated to capital projects. For 2014, Buhari said N400 million was voted for housing, Omokri said N12.89 billion was voted, but the budget office says N21.38 billion was voted for housing the federal ministry of land, housing and urban development, with N15.76 billion for capital projects.

On Saturday, October 1, 1960, Nigeria became an independent nation. What follows is Sir Abubakar Tafawa Balewa’s speech delivered at Tafawa Balewa Square in Lagos at the Independence Ceremony. Today is Independence Day. The first of October 1960 is a date to which for two years every Nigerian has been eagerly looking forward. At last, our great day has arrived, and Nigeria is now indeed an independent sovereign nation. Words cannot adequately express my joy and pride at being the Nigerian citizen privileged to accept from Her Royal Highness these Constitutional Instruments which are the symbols of Nigeria’s Independence.

Time will not permit the individual mention of all those friends, many of them Nigerians, whose selfless labours have contributed to our Independence. Some have not lived to see the fulfilment of their hopes—on them be peace—but nevertheless they are remembered here, and the names of buildings and streets and roads and bridges throughout the country recall to our minds their achievements, some of them on a national scale. Others confined, perhaps, to a small area in one Division, are more humble but of equal value in the sum-total. Today, we have with us representatives of those who have made Nigeria: Representatives of the Regional Governments, of former Central Governments, of the Missionary Societies, and of the Banking and Commercial enterprises, and members, both past and present, of the Public Service.

In Nigeria’s case, the price of Brent crude was just over $26 a barrel on April 2, whereas Nigeria’s budget assumes a price of $57 per barrel and would still have run on a 2.18 trillion naira ($6.05 billion) deficit. Similarly, with oil accounting for 90 percent of Nigeria’s exports, the decline in the demand for oil and oil prices will adversely affect the volume and value of net exports. Indeed, the steep decline in oil prices associated with the pandemic has necessitated that the Nigerian government cut planned expenditure. In fact, on March 18, the minister of finance announced a 1.5 trillion naira ($4.17 billion) cut in nonessential capital spending.

Oil slump: Nigeria economy to contract 3.4 percent in 2020 Africa’s top oil producer cut its budget for a second time this year; it expects to earn far less oil revenue in 2020. Nigeria’s economy is projected to contract by 3.4 percent this year, government officials said on Tuesday, as dwindling oil revenues and the new coronavirus forced it to cut budget plans for a second time. The West African nation was assuming a lower petroleum price of $20 per barrel.
		

What was the percentage change in the price of oil over the specified time period, and what time frame is being referred to in the context of Nigeria's main export?		
A: The petroleum sector is a central pillar of Nigeria’s economy, contributing about half of the government's revenue and 90 percent of Nigeria's export earnings. In 2016, Nigeria experienced a double shock based on a fall in global oil prices and supply problems due to disruptions in the Niger Delta, home to much of the country’s oil and gas reserves. Then, millions more people fell into extreme poverty. Today, under the shadow of COVID-19, Nigeria (and numerous other countries around the world) is projected to fall into recession. The World Bank estimates that the number of poor people in Nigeria is likely to increase by several million by 2022.

Amid Oil Price Collapse, Nigeria Is Running out of Foreign Exchange The fall in international oil prices is having a devastating impact on Nigeria’s formal economy. Oil, the property of the Nigerian government, provides more than 60 percent of government revenue. Further, sales, denominated in U.S. dollars, account for more than 90 percent of Nigeria’s foreign exchange. The oil price drop, while made worse by the economic consequences of the coronavirus pandemic, began thanks to a price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia.

A: Many African countries, as with those in the rest of the world, have instituted partial or total lockdowns to contain the spread of the virus. A recent World Bank Group analysis shows that COVID-19 will likely lead to output losses as high as $79 billion in the Sub-Saharan region, where economic growth is expected to fall from 2.4 percent in 2019 to between -2.1 and -5.1 percent in 2020. Nigeria, Africa’s largest economy and a major oil exporter, will be negatively impacted, especially in light of its slow recovery from a 2016 recession.

What was the percentage change in the price of oil over the specified time period, and what time frame is being referred to in the context of Nigeria's main export?		
The 70 percent price drop during that period was one of the three biggest declines since World War II, and the longest lasting since the supply-driven collapse of 1986. Supply glut reinforced by weakening demand prospects The initial drop in oil prices from mid-2014 to early 2015 was primarily driven by supply factors, including booming U.S. oil production, receding geopolitical concerns, and shifting OPEC policies. However, deteriorating demand prospects played a role as well, particularly from mid-2015 to early 2016.

In addition, the interest rates on all CBN interventions have been revised downwards from 9 to 5 percent, and a one-year moratorium on CBN intervention facilities has been introduced, effective March 1. With oil being Nigeria’s major source of foreign exchange, amid the steep decline in oil prices, the official exchange rate has been adjusted from 306 to 360 naira. The exchange rate under the investors and exporters (I&E) window has also been adjusted from 360 to 380 naira in order to unify the exchange rates across the I&E window, Bureau de Change, and retail and wholesale windows. Furthermore, the government has introduced import duty waivers for pharmaceutical companies and increased efforts toward ensuring that they receive forex.

A meme circulated by a pro-Labour Facebook page quotes New Zealand’s National Party leader, Judith Collins, as praising US president Donald Trump during the second debate of the 2020 election campaign. The post features Ms Collins’ image alongside the quote: “He’s a damn sight better than any of the other Presidents that have been there before him, including those that you admire, Miss Ardern.” Below the image are the words: “Judith Collins on Donald Trump.” The October 1 Facebook post from the Backing the Kiwi Meme page is a screengrab of a Twitter post that carried the meme.

Actually I think keeping away from war is a good thing.” Former US secretary of defense Robert Gates, who served under both presidents George Bush and Barack Obama, recently delivered similar praise on Meet the Press, saying: “Unlike (Mr Trump’s) three predecessors … at least he hasn’t started any new wars.” Earlier Ms Collins said she thought Mr Trump “could have done better” with the COVID-19 response in the United States, and both leaders said they would work with whichever candidate won the election. While the quote included in the Facebook meme is largely accurate, the word “it’s” in Ms Collins’ debate response – a reference to Mr Trump’s record in initiating wars – has been replaced with “he’s”, wrongly implying that the National leader said the current US president was better than all those before him.

They’ll also point out Robert Byrd was a Democrat and minor member of KKK,but neglect that he left and was eventually recognized by NAACP and that David Duke endorsed their golden boy, Donald. Whether Donald wanted his endorsement is irrelevant, the point is why endorse Donald at all and not apparent KKK heir Hillary? Also, Marx worked as an editor and contributor for a newspaper. He was then supported by his wealthier friend to keep producing work, somewhat like an artist with a patron.

231,Nigeria’s urban population at independence was approximately 7 million.,"What was the urban population of Nigeria at the time of its independence in 1960?		
Home to Over Half the Population, Nigeria's Cities Continue to Boom In an article for Bloomberg, Judd Devremont and Todd Moss highlight the rapid urbanization of Africa, arguing that the success or failure of Africa in the global economy will depend on its cities. In Nigeria, this can be seen most clearly in Lagos. At independence in 1960, Lagos had an estimated population of 763,000; today it is about 13 million. Together with Lagos state, the population reaches 21 million.
		

What was the urban population of Nigeria at the time of its independence in 1960?		
While Lagos is by far the largest city in Nigeria, security concerns, rural poverty, and hopes for greater economic opportunity are driving people to cities all over the country. In the decade between 2007 and 2017, Nigeria’s urban dwellers increased from 41 percent of the population to about 50 percent. In 2019, there were 7 cities with a population of one million or more, 80 with a population ranging between one hundred thousand and one million, and 248 with a population between ten thousand and one hundred thousand. But much of this urbanization is unplanned and chaotic. According to a World Bank report about African cities, ""Africa’s cities feel crowded precisely because they are not dense with economic activity, infrastructure, or housing and commercial structures.""
		

What was the urban population of Nigeria at the time of its independence in 1960?		
About 257,000 people left Nigeria's northwestern region according to Nigeria's 1952-1953 census. Their destinations included the Gold Coast, Dahomey, and Togo, out of which 28,000 people were mostly from Northern Sokoto. Substantial emigrant streams were particularly reported for the Yoruba of southwest Nigeria to Côte d'Ivoire, Upper Volta (now Burkina Faso), Dahomey, Mali, Togo, Niger, and Ghana. These movements were linked to the artificial nature of colonial boundaries, which split the people of common culture and ethnic groupings into different countries. Flows from Nigeria to countries beyond the region did not occur on a large scale until after independence in 1960.
		

What was the urban population of Nigeria at the time of its independence in 1960?		
The new state capitals, which became home to various state and federal government departments and agencies, as well as related businesses, drew construction workers, job seekers, traders, and relocating civil servants and their families. Similarly, the creation of 776 local government areas between 1976 and 1996 made these places attractive destinations. When the military-run government made Abuja the capital, in 1991, 200,000 public sector workers, along with staff of foreign embassies and multilateral and bilateral agencies, relocated from Lagos. Abuja's population was 378,671 according to the 1991 census, but the city's population growth accelerated when a democratic government took office in 1999.
		

What was the urban population of Nigeria at the time of its independence in 1960?		
During colonial rule, Nigeria also experienced international flows. Geographer Adejumoke Afolayan and colleagues have found evidence of immigration and emigration as far back as 1903. An estimated 10,000 to 30,000 Tuaregs from Niger moved into Kano city and its environs between 1914 and 1922. Kano city offered better grazing facilities, wells for pastoralists and their flocks, veterinary services, and lower taxes. For similar reasons, another 250,000 people moved into the northwestern region of Nigeria between 1931 and 1952 from French West Africa, which extended from Lake Chad to Dakar, Senegal, and from the Sahara to the Gulf of Guinea; the flow dates back to the beginning of the 20th century.
		

What was the urban population of Nigeria at the time of its independence in 1960?		
By 2006, Abuja's population had more than doubled to 778,567, making it the fastest case of urbanization in West Africa. The country's southwest, which includes Lagos (population 18 million) and Ibadan, attracts migrants from all over Nigeria. The region hosts the nation's two largest seaports, 65 percent of its industrial plants, large proportions of educational and research institutions, and large agricultural plantations. Internal migrants come from Nigeria's significantly less developed regions. For example, the southeastern region has been a major source of internal migration for several decades due to poor environmental and economic conditions.
		

What was the urban population of Nigeria at the time of its independence in 1960?		
There is no consensus on the exact number of Nigerians who live outside the country. Estimates from the last decade vary widely, from 3 to 6 million (the Nigerian National Volunteer Service in 2006) to 15 million (2002 Christian Science Monitor article) to about 20 million (Lagos-based Bank of Industry in 2009). The bases for these estimates remain unclear, hence we use the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) estimate of about 1.13 million Nigerians living in another country in 2010. This number has consistently increased since 1960 (see Table 1). Of this group, 62 percent are in other African countries, with smaller shares in Europe and North America, a small presence in Asia, and a minimal presence in Oceania, Latin America, and the Caribbean. Presenting a similar picture but with a breakdown by country that uses 2000-2001 census data, the University of Sussex's Global Migrant Origin Database reveals that nearly a quarter of Nigerians were in Sudan, with 14 percent in the United States, 9 percent in the United Kingdom, 8 percent in Cameroon, and 5 percent in Ghana (see Figure 3).
		

What was the urban population of Nigeria at the time of its independence in 1960?		
Again, an estimated 700,000 persons were expelled, out of which 300,000 were Ghanaians and 100,000 were Nigeriens. Despite the emotions stirred by both expulsions, Nigeria was assessed to have acted within its rights under the ECOWAS agreement. While statistics on intraregional flows are generally unreliable, 2006 estimates from the ECOWAS Statistics Office suggest that West African migrants account for approximately 10 percent of the total population in most West African countries. Relative to her population size, Nigeria has a significantly smaller ECOWAS population than other Member States.
		

What was the urban population of Nigeria at the time of its independence in 1960?		
Nigeria: Multiple Forms of Mobility in Africa's Demographic Giant As Africa's most populous country, Nigeria, with an estimated population of 150 million and over 250 ethnic groups, deals with a range of migration issues, from massive internal and regional migration to brain drain and a large, well-educated diaspora in the West (mainly the United States and the United Kingdom) that it sees as key to future development. Thousands of Nigerians seek refuge and asylum each year, and some also migrate illegally, transiting through North Africa and then crossing the Mediterranean to Europe. Poverty drives much of this movement: more than 70 percent of Nigerians live below the national poverty line.
		

What was the urban population of Nigeria at the time of its independence in 1960?		
From the 1950s through the 1970s, the emerging elites moved mainly to the United Kingdom due to the legacy of colonial ties, for educational pursuit, and in a few cases for administrative matters. The expectation was that Nigerian students would return with valuable skills needed for nation building. Indeed, most Nigerians educated abroad in the 1960s and 1970s readily came home after completing their education to assured plum jobs in the civil service or the burgeoning oil and private sectors of the economy. After independence in 1960, this largely highly skilled migration to the United Kingdom continued, although an increasing proportion of Nigerians also migrated to the United States for study, business, and work.

Shaken by the attack, Biden called her comments “a mischaracterization of my position.” The exchange resurfaced recently with a report that one of Biden’s closest friends and a co-chair of his vice presidential vetting committee, former Connecticut Sen. Chris Dodd, still harbors concerns about the debate and that Harris hadn’t expressed regret. The comments attributed to Dodd and first reported by Politico drew condemnation, especially from influential Democratic women who said Harris was being held to a standard that wouldn’t apply to a man running for president.

Harris was also close with Biden’s late son, Beau, who served as Delaware attorney general while she held the same post in California. But Biden and Harris have since returned to a warm relationship. “Joe has empathy, he has a proven track record of leadership and more than ever before we need a president of the United States who understands who the people are, sees them where they are, and has a genuine desire to help and knows how to fight to get us where we need to be,” Harris said at an event for Biden earlier this summer.

Harris’s record as California attorney general and district attorney in San Francisco was heavily scrutinized during the Democratic primary and turned away some liberals and younger Black voters who saw her as out of step on issues of racism in the legal system and police brutality. She declared herself a “progressive prosecutor” who backs law enforcement reforms. Biden, who spent eight years as President Barack Obama’s vice president, has spent months weighing who would fill that same role in his White House. He pledged in March to select a woman as his vice president, easing frustration among Democrats that the presidential race would center on two white men in their 70s.

Last month, we made face coverings mandatory on public transport and in NHS settings. This has been successful in giving people more confidence to go on public transport and to a hospital setting when they need to. Providing people with additional protection when they are not able to keep 2 metres from others, particularly people they do not normally come into contact with. Under the new rules, people who do not wear a face covering will face a fine of up to £100, in line with the sanction on public transport and just as with public transport, children under 11 and those with certain disabilities will be exempt.
		

What is the current legal requirement in England regarding face coverings, and what are the penalties for non-compliance as of the time of the claim?		
It is illegal to wear clothing which covers the entire face, or covered up to the point where only the eyes are uncovered, or renders the face unrecognisable, on public transport and in buildings and associated yards of educational institutions, governmental institutions and healthcare institutions. Frequently cited examples are a full face helmet, a balaclava, a burqa or a niqāb. Clothes exempt from the Act are: - those worn by clients, patients or their visitors in residential parts of healthcare institutions; - those necessary for the protection of the body in relation to health or security;
		

What is the current legal requirement in England regarding face coverings, and what are the penalties for non-compliance as of the time of the claim?		
Parliament approved new legislation on 16 May 2017, which stipulates that people who wear clothing that covers their faces, such as burqas, niqabs, full face helmets or scarves (motorcyclists) etc. in places like universities, public transportation or courthouses will face fines of 150 euros (about $167). The measure took effect in October 2017.[13][14] Shortly after the enactment on 1 October 2017, there were some incidents in which people were incorrectly fined by the police, leading some commentators to point out flaws in the law, or incorrect understanding of it amongst the police.[14] A Belgian law adopted in June 2011 prohibits appearing in public ""with a face masked or hidden, in whole or in part, in such a way as to be unidentifiable"".

What is the current legal requirement in England regarding face coverings, and what are the penalties for non-compliance as of the time of the claim?		
The liability for wearing a face covering lies with the individual. Should an individual without an exemption refuse to wear a face covering, a shop can refuse them entry and can call the police if people refuse to comply, the police have the formal enforcement powers and can issue a fine. This is in line with how shops would normally manage their customers and enforcement is of course a last resort, and we fully expect the public to comply with the rules as they have done throughout the pandemic. I want to give this message to everyone who has been making vital changes to their daily lives, for the greater good.
		

What is the current legal requirement in England regarding face coverings, and what are the penalties for non-compliance as of the time of the claim?		
This violation can be fined with imprisonment up to one year.[20] In Italy, a law issued in 1975 strictly forbids wearing of any attire that could hide the face of a person. Penalties (fines and imprisonment) are provided for such behaviour. The original purpose of the anti-mask law was to prevent crime or terrorism. The law allows for exemptions for a ""justified cause"", which has sometimes been interpreted by courts as including religious reasons for wearing a veil, but others –including local governments– disagree and claim religion is not a ""justified cause"" in this context.[21]
		

What is the current legal requirement in England regarding face coverings, and what are the penalties for non-compliance as of the time of the claim?		
An authorised person (R. 7(11)) who reasonably believes an individual has committed an offence under the Regulations can issue an FPN, provided the individual is aged 18 or over (R. 7(1)). R 7A (introduced on 28 August 2020) explains the amount of the fixed penalty depends on when the breach was committed; whether the breach is a first or subsequent breach, and what Coronavirus Regulations breaches are taken into account in assessing this. The Secretary of State must review the need for the requirements within the period of 6 months of their coming into force (R. 9).

- New South Wales police can require a motorist to remove head coverings, including masks, for identification purposes.[43] On 4 October 2019, the Government of Hong Kong invoked the rarely used colonial-era Emergency Regulations Ordinance to implement the Prohibition on Face Covering Regulation (PFCR), an anti-mask law[44] in response to the ongoing protest that year. The law bans protesters from covering their faces whether in full or partially during protests, including at rallies given a ""Letter of No Objection"" under the Public Order Ordinance.[45] Anyone who wears a mask at a lawful rally or march, unlawful or unauthorised assembly, or during a riot could be sentenced to up to a year in jail and a fine of HK$25,000.

Testing saves lives and lets people know if they need to take precautions, like isolating, to stop the virus from spreading; infected people without symptoms can still spread the virus. Testing also helps public health officials identify and respond to outbreaks, and to track new variants of the virus. If you feel sick or have COVID‑19 symptoms, get tested right away, even if you're vaccinated. If you test positive, most treatments for COVID‑19 must start within 5 days of feeling sick. - If you feel sick. COVID-19 has a wide range of symptoms, so if you’re not feeling well, it’s best to get tested as soon as possible.

What is the current scientific understanding of how COVID-19 transmission occurs and spreads, and how do testing rates impact the perception and management of the pandemic?		
You may have another viral infection or illness or it may be too early in your infection to detect COVID-19. Consider repeat testing for COVID-19 with a self-test in a day or two, especially if you know you were exposed to someone else with COVID-19, or talk to your healthcare provider. Some self-tests are designed to be repeated. Repeated (sometimes called serial) self-testing is when a person tests themselves multiple times for COVID-19, or on a routine basis, such as every few days. By testing more frequently, you might detect the virus that causes COVID-19 more quickly and could reduce the spread of infection.
		

What is the current scientific understanding of how COVID-19 transmission occurs and spreads, and how do testing rates impact the perception and management of the pandemic?		
I feel sick or was exposed to COVID-19. When should I test? Take steps now to prevent possible spread, including staying away from others. If you feel sick or have symptoms: Get tested immediately. If you were exposed to COVID-19: Get tested at least five full days after your last exposure – even if you don’t develop symptoms.
		

What is the current scientific understanding of how COVID-19 transmission occurs and spreads, and how do testing rates impact the perception and management of the pandemic?		
Testing of all people for SARS-CoV-2, including those who have no symptoms, who show symptoms of infection such as trouble breathing, fever, sore throat or loss of the sense of smell and taste, and who may have been exposed to the virus will help prevent the spread of COVID-19 by identifying people who are in need of care in a timely fashion. A positive test early in the course of the illness enables individuals to isolate themselves – reducing the chances that they will infect others and allowing them to seek treatment earlier, likely reducing disease severity and the risk of long-term disability, or death. Testing of people who have been in contact with others who have a documented infection is also important. A negative test doesn’t mean you’re in the clear; you could become infectious later. Therefore, even if you test negative, you need to continue to protect yourself and others by washing your hands frequently, physically distancing, and wearing a face mask.

What is the current scientific understanding of how COVID-19 transmission occurs and spreads, and how do testing rates impact the perception and management of the pandemic?		
Scientists from the NIH and across the country are working around the clock to establish programs that will ensure access to and acceptance of rapid and reliable testing around the country. Testing can help people determine if they are infected with SARS-CoV-2 – regardless of whether they have symptoms – and whether they are at risk of spreading the infection to others. Taking measures to prevent the spread of infection will be the most effective strategy for getting us safely back to work and school. We want to take this opportunity to articulate why widespread testing is necessary, important, and achievable.

237,"The alleged concerns of the United States over Cuba's cooperation, in this case about the ‘More Doctors’ program, are neither legitimate nor pertinent to be discussed at PAHO [Pan American Health Organization].","What specific actions or statements have the United States made regarding concerns about Cuba's 'More Doctors' program in the context of the PAHO, and how have these concerns been addressed or refuted by the PAHO or other international bodies?		
- Recognizes evidence that the Cuban regime’s deployment of Cuban doctors during the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as through the Mais Médicos program in Brazil between 2013 and 2018, constitute human trafficking, and documents concerns by the UN Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of slavery and the UN Special Rapporteur on trafficking in persons. - Requires the Departments of State and Health and Human Services to implement a balanced approach to address the Pan American Health Organization’s role in the Mais Médicos program—mandating transparency and accountability, preventing future support for Cuban medical missions, and ensuring PAHO has necessary funding to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic and other health needs in the region.
		

What specific actions or statements have the United States made regarding concerns about Cuba's 'More Doctors' program in the context of the PAHO, and how have these concerns been addressed or refuted by the PAHO or other international bodies?		
Indeed, despite these efforts to support the development of health systems and respond to health crises, Cuba does not frame these activities within the discourse of health security. Rather, Cuba’s medical internationalism is framed as the embodiment of international solidarity and considered an extension of Cuba’s national health policy within the socialist framework. Interviewees cited ‘serving a global population’ rather than protecting Cuba’s citizens against pathogen spread as reason for crisis interventions.9 Recent media coverage of the closure of the Mais Medicos programme20 in Brazil has focused on the political determinants of these overseas medical missions, where Cuban doctors are sent to provide healthcare in exchange for oil or hard currency.12 21 Political motivations have also been suggested as standing behind Cuba’s provision of over half of the medical professionals for Mission Barrio Adentro in Venezuela, Chavez’s (now failing) health and social welfare programmes focused on delivering universal healthcare across poorer neighbourhoods.22 Such activities have spurred discussion on the motivation for this Cuban international activity, whether driven by international prestige,14 goodwill, soft power,12 solidarity13 or economic gain.23 Cuba’s medical missions have also been criticised for violating the (labour) rights of those deployed.
		

What specific actions or statements have the United States made regarding concerns about Cuba's 'More Doctors' program in the context of the PAHO, and how have these concerns been addressed or refuted by the PAHO or other international bodies?		
There is some suggestion, for example, that these doctors may not have autonomous decision-making regarding whether they want to deploy on these international missions, but rather are forced to do so by the government.24 Recent legal proceedings in Brazil, moreover, have sought to show that the Cuban model of exporting physicians for economic gain violates the International Labour Organization’s agreement on the protection of wages.24 This is based on the findings from the Mais Medicos programme that suggest that Cuban medics received significantly less in wages than their international counterparts, with the majority of the wages paid directly by Brazil to Cuba for its doctors being retained by the Cuban state.23 24 Discussions about the profit-making nature of these overseas medical missions suggest that Cuba’s medical internationalism may be less about a notion of international solidarity or global health security, but rather functions as a form of income generation for the government within a failing economic system. In this respect, the contribution of these missions to global health security might be overegged and simply a by-product of government financing. Nevertheless, we suggest that this activity could be considered part of a Cuban contribution to global health security and may offer lessons for strengthening national and global rapid response capacities for disease emergence, as the deployments and training of the Henry Reeve Brigade suggests.
		

What specific actions or statements have the United States made regarding concerns about Cuba's 'More Doctors' program in the context of the PAHO, and how have these concerns been addressed or refuted by the PAHO or other international bodies?		
The ethical implications of medical diplomacy are complicated. Cuba currently employs more than 28,000 medical staff in sixty countries Cuba currently employs more than 28,000 medical staff in sixty countries, and it has used these efforts to leverage soft power in its relationships with other countries. However, the country also falls short on the ethical treatment of its own work force. Cuba been heavily criticized for its treatment of these providers.
		

What specific actions or statements have the United States made regarding concerns about Cuba's 'More Doctors' program in the context of the PAHO, and how have these concerns been addressed or refuted by the PAHO or other international bodies?		
An opportunity to ask what lessons the United States can learn from Cuba Medical diplomacy is a cornerstone national goal for Cuba, and the country has long championed their commitment to health as a “moral incentive.” The small island nation has not only based much of their own health care system on the concept of universal coverage, but has consistently sent their own doctors abroad to other sites during times of need. Notable examples include its response in Chile after an earthquake in 1960, the then-Soviet Union following the Chernobyl explosion in 1986, Indonesia after the 2004 Tsunami, and West African countries to fight Ebola in 2014.
		

What specific actions or statements have the United States made regarding concerns about Cuba's 'More Doctors' program in the context of the PAHO, and how have these concerns been addressed or refuted by the PAHO or other international bodies?		
- Cuba’s history of medical internationalism and its domestic disease prevention and control activities speak directly to these debates; yet, Cuba is largely absent within global health security academic and policy discourse. Cuba’s international medical activities focused on routine health provision and crisis response, alongside its domestic disease control activities and universal health system demonstrate that Cuba has a strong health security capacity. - Health security in Cuba also faces challenges, however, particularly with respect to the trade-off between civil liberties, regime preservation and security in protecting the state and its population from diseases threats, and with respect to resource constraints, exacerbated by the US embargo. - Cuba does not frame its disease control activities within a discourse of health securitywhich impacts Cuba’s visibility and participation in the global health security regime.
		

What specific actions or statements have the United States made regarding concerns about Cuba's 'More Doctors' program in the context of the PAHO, and how have these concerns been addressed or refuted by the PAHO or other international bodies?		
Efforts in this direction have begun. A major impetus is the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), which became law in March 2010. It includes significant funding for public health over the next decade, emphasis on prevention and wellness strategies, and incentives to develop partnerships among clinical and public health entities, governmental and nongovernmental alike, to improve health.7 We suggest that lessons for maximizing the potential of the ACA and other significant efforts to improve our population’s health status can be found in the experience of Cuba, despite differences in our political-social systems and available resources. More than 50 years of political enmity separating Cuba and the United States, complicated by a United States embargo prohibiting normal trade in food, medicines and medical equipment, and official programs aiming at regime change on the island, have made it difficult for Cuba’s National Health System (NHS) and its outcomes to be thoughtfully considered by the United States media, the public, or policymakers.
		

What specific actions or statements have the United States made regarding concerns about Cuba's 'More Doctors' program in the context of the PAHO, and how have these concerns been addressed or refuted by the PAHO or other international bodies?		
Cuba trained more than 500 Haitian physicians at no cost, sent more than 6,000 of their own doctors to work, provided almost fifteen million medical consultations, and taught literacy to 165,000 Haitians. What would happen if the United States expanded its understanding of medical diplomacy beyond funding? The United States, via the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), sent almost $50 million to Haiti and the Dominican Republic for humanitarian assistance following the disaster. American physicians did volunteer through organizations such as Doctors without Borders, but the federal response was primarily financial—though the United States did employ both economic and human capital in their response to Ebola epidemic a few years later.
		

What specific actions or statements have the United States made regarding concerns about Cuba's 'More Doctors' program in the context of the PAHO, and how have these concerns been addressed or refuted by the PAHO or other international bodies?		
“For smaller African or Caribbean countries, who can’t necessarily afford to pay for the doctors, it gets them on Cuba’s side,” he says. “They’ll be more lenient towards Cuba when they’re under international pressure from Europe and the United States [to oppose it].” Sending doctors abroad for humanitarian purposes is also great PR for the country. Cuban medics won praise in international media for their efficacy and commitment after Haiti’s 2010 earthquake and during West Africa’s 2014 Ebola crisis. That helps to put a palatable face on an authoritarian regime that fiercely represses dissent, restricts its citizens’ rights to travel and carries out thousands of arbitrary detentions every year.
		

What specific actions or statements have the United States made regarding concerns about Cuba's 'More Doctors' program in the context of the PAHO, and how have these concerns been addressed or refuted by the PAHO or other international bodies?		
I also want to thank my colleagues, both onstage and in the audience, from the State Department and USAID. I think the high-level participation in this briefing is a reflection of how seriously the United States takes the accusations against the Cuban regime. I really don’t want to say too much upfront, because the whole purpose of this briefing is to hear from our doctors, Dr. Matos and Dr. Carballo. Their government, the Cuban regime, has really denied them a voice for years. During their abuse they had their voices, their families, their money, their freedoms, in some cases their lives, stolen from them.

Public electricity and heat production. This was primarily due to a decrease in natural gas-fired  generation in response to higher levels of hydro generation.

Did Judith Collins specifically attribute New Zealand's increased use of coal for electricity generation to the oil and gas exploration ban in any official statement or public appearance?		
There is also the potential for some coal-fired plants to retire early, leading to higher wholesale electricity prices. This would encourage further investment in renewable generation. Current state government policies are supportive of renewable investment over the longer term, with most state and territory governments targeting at least 40 per cent renewable generation by 2030. However, existing Australian Government policy will provide less support than in the past given the RET has been met.

241,President Joe Biden is abusing the prescription drug Adderall.,"Is there any verified public information or credible source that confirms President Joe Biden has been diagnosed with a condition that requires the prescription of Adderall or has a history of abusing prescription drugs?		
On Sunday, President Donald Trump “strongly demanded” that his Democratic opponent, Joe Biden, be drug tested for Tuesday’s debate. Only drugs could explain why “Sleepy Joe Biden” sometimes wasn’t so sleepy at all, Trump alleged. If it initially sounded like the president may have been referring to another drug that was famously popular in his heyday in 1980s New York, a surrogate, Rudy Giuliani, clarified things on Fox & Friends on Tuesday morning. He claimed that Biden “has dementia. There’s no doubt about it. I’ve talked to doctors”—and then added: “The president’s quite right to say maybe [Biden]’s taken Adderall.” There’s no evidence to suggest Biden is actually on any drugs, legal or otherwise. But purely hypothetically: Would Adderall really do what Giuliani (and by implication, Trump) claims?
		

Is there any verified public information or credible source that confirms President Joe Biden has been diagnosed with a condition that requires the prescription of Adderall or has a history of abusing prescription drugs?		
Former White House physician Ronny Jackson, who is now a Republican congressional candidate, told Fox News on Monday there was reason to wonder about Biden's alleged drug-taking. ""But I think it's reasonable to ask if he's taking medications to help him with his alertness and his memory,"" Jackson told the network's Sean Hannity. Is there evidence of Biden taking performance-enhancing drugs? There is no evidence that Biden is taking performance-enhancing drugs, in spite of the president's suggestion.

Despite a lot of commentary on the matter, there is no evidence that Trump is taking performance-enhancing drugs. His stated willingness to be drug tested for the debates would also seem to undermine this claim, although the medical records from his doctor do not include the results of any drug tests. Accusations of Biden taking performance-enhancing drugs Trump has made unverified accusations that Biden took drugs to improve his debate performance in the Democratic primaries.

What kind of miracle drugs does Trump think Biden would need here? Slate spoke to Michael T. Swanoski, a professor at the University of Minnesota’s College of Pharmacy, to get into what is and isn’t scientifically possible. Our conversation has been condensed and edited for clarity. Heather Schwedel: How would a drug like Adderall affect someone’s debate performances? Michael T. Swanoski: Adderall is a stimulant that’s often prescribed for attention deficit disorder. So Adderall potentially could increase your attentiveness if you’re feeling drowsy or if you’re fatigued.

Giuliani also said “the president’s quite right to say maybe [Biden has] taken Adderall,” implying it would be a treatment for his supposed “sleepiness.” Dementia is not lack of energy; there’s damage going on in the brain. There’s neural damage that occurs that then impairs the function of these neural transmitters, these chemicals like acetylcholine, which is this chemical that’s really responsible in large part for our normal cognitive function. And so someone with dementia would not be treated with amphetamines to get them more alert. It wouldn’t increase their brain acuity at all. It would make them jittery, more confused, really, because they wouldn’t be able to think clearly. Drugs for dementia are primarily aimed at increasing levels of acetylcholine, like Donepezil, which is used for Alzheimer’s dementia.

Siegel, who recently fawned over Trump’s ability to repeat the phrase “person, man, woman, camera, TV,” suggested that Biden may have suffered a “silent stroke” due to his atrial fibrillation and therefore was prescribed certain drugs. “So now, President Trump says, ‘You know, we should have drug testing before debates,’ and I’m thinking why would he be saying that?” Siegel continued to speculate. “There’s a study that shows that for people who have mild cognitive thinking or memory problems, you know what helps? “You know what helps? Adderall, a drug that I prescribe,” the doctor added. “These drugs can help in low doses for short periods of time.”
		

Is there any verified public information or credible source that confirms President Joe Biden has been diagnosed with a condition that requires the prescription of Adderall or has a history of abusing prescription drugs?		
President Donald Trump has spent the past few weeks baselessly accusing Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden of using drugs to improve his debate performance, insisting that Biden will get a “big fat shot in the ass” and will be “better than ever before” for a short period of time. The president’s ridiculous claims, which he’s used to demand that Biden take a drug test before the debates, were given an air of legitimacy Monday night by Fox News medical contributor Dr. Marc Siegel, who wildly speculated that the former vice president is using speed and Adderall. Fox News host Tucker Carlson, who has repeatedly suggested Biden is suffering from mental decline, once again took aim at the presidential hopeful on Monday night, mocking him for his latest verbal gaffe. In this instance, it was Biden mistakenly saying nearly 200 million Americans had died from the coronavirus, rather than 200,000.

Actor and comedian Tom Arnold accused President Donald Trump of previously taking the drug on the set of NBC's The Apprentice. ""Donald Trump abused Adderall on the set & it made him crazy. He even snorted Adderall. Mark Burnett knew it. Trump's refusal to release his medical records has only added to the speculation about his health and some of his public appearances, like his walk down a ramp at West Point, have contributed to concerns about his health. Is there evidence of Trump taking performance-enhancing drugs?
		

Is there any verified public information or credible source that confirms President Joe Biden has been diagnosed with a condition that requires the prescription of Adderall or has a history of abusing prescription drugs?		
Clearly terrified about going head-to-head with Biden on Tuesday, Trump’s supporters have fanned out to push the theory that the former vice president’s behavior demonstrates both that he is in cognitive decline and that he’s taking Adderall or other such performance-enhancing drugs. On Fox News, former White House physician Ronny Jackson—who earned the nickname “Candyman” for allegedly giving out drugs like candy, a charge he denies—told Sean Hannity that, in his medical opinion, “there’s definitely something going on here” and that the only reason it’s not being reported is because the media is in the can for Democrats: “The media is the communications branch for the Democratic Party,” Jackson told Hannity Monday night, “and they’re just aggressively covering for [Biden]. Obviously something is going on with this man at this point, I mean they keep him locked away for 90% of the time

The president has recently added fuel to the fire by demanding a drug test before or after the debate. Accusations Trump is taking performance-enhancing drugs There has long been unverified speculation that Trump uses drugs. This appears to have started during the 2016 presidential debates with former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, when Trump's sniffing was linked to possible drug use. Some have accused the president of snorting Adderall, a stimulant used to enhance focus or treat attention issues.

242,"U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention downgrades COVID-19, rating it less fatal than seasonal flu","Has the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention officially released any statements or reports comparing the fatality rates of COVID-19 and the seasonal flu, specifically indicating that COVID-19 is rated less fatal than the seasonal flu?		
""This time around – with more advanced medical care and public health systems bringing fatalities down to 50 a month per 100,000 during the same March-to-May dates the previous three years – the number of deaths quadrupled,"" USA TODAY reported Aug. 13. Experts determined COVID-19 to be more deadly than the seasonal flu. There is a vaccine for the seasonal flu, keeping cases down; there is not a vaccine for COVID-19. The COVID-19 ratio of deaths per 100 cases in the USA was 3.1% as of Thursday, and the approximate 0.05% mortality rate is one of the highest in the world, according to Johns Hopkins University. The CDC reported that the annual mortality rate for the seasonal flu is about 0.01%, or 12,000-61,000 deaths per year.

Fact check: COVID-19 is deadlier than the 1918 Spanish flu and seasonal influenza The claim: Experts exaggerate the gravity of COVID-19 death rates in comparison with the Spanish flu and seasonal flu Many claims have attempted to compare the COVID-19 pandemic with prior pandemics, such as the Spanish flu in 1918 or the swine flu in 2009. Others have tried to brush off the novel coronavirus symptoms and rate of infection as akin to the seasonal flu.
		

Has the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention officially released any statements or reports comparing the fatality rates of COVID-19 and the seasonal flu, specifically indicating that COVID-19 is rated less fatal than the seasonal flu?		
Yet public officials continue to draw comparisons between seasonal influenza and SARS-CoV-2 mortality, often in an attempt to minimize the effects of the unfolding pandemic. The root of such incorrect comparisons may be a knowledge gap regarding how seasonal influenza and COVID-19 data are publicly reported. The CDC, like many similar disease control agencies around the world, presents seasonal influenza morbidity and mortality not as raw counts but as calculated estimates based on submitted International Classification of Diseases codes.2 Between 2013-2014 and 2018-2019, the reported yearly estimated influenza deaths ranged from 23 000 to 61 000.3 Over that same time period, however, the number of counted influenza deaths was between 3448 and 15 620 yearly.4

The comparable rate of death for the seasonal flu is 0.1%. “COVID-19 infection is deadlier than flu — we can put that debate to rest,” said study author Anirban Basu, professor of health economics and Stergachis Family Endowed Director of the CHOICE Institute at the UW School of Pharmacy. The School of Pharmacy and Basu have developed a website that explores the infection and fatality rates by U.S. counties for people with symptoms. For this study, 116 counties in 33 states had COVID-19 data that fit Basu’s robust criteria for inclusion in the analysis.

Since COVID-19 emerged in China two and a half months ago, ""it clearly is not as lethal ... but it certainly spreads better,"" he said, adding seasonal flu has a mortality rate of 0.1%. The WHO's estimated mortality rate for COVID-19 started off at 2%, Fauci said. If you count all the estimated cases of people who may have it but haven't been diagnosed yet, the mortality rate is probably closer to 1%, he said, ""which means it's 10 times more lethal than the seasonal flu."" The H1N1 ""swine flu"" epidemic in 2009 was even less lethal than regular seasonal flu, Fauci said. While COVID-19 cases are slowing in China, where the outbreak originated in December, it's picking up pace across other parts of the world.

Related: Can homemade masks protect you from COVID-19? The death rate from seasonal flu is typically around 0.1% in the U.S., according to news reports. Though the death rate for COVID-19 is unclear, almost all credible research suggests it is much higher than that of the seasonal flu. It's important to note that there is no one death rate for COVID-19; the rate can vary by location, age of person infected and the presence of underlying health conditions, Live Science previously reported.
		

Has the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention officially released any statements or reports comparing the fatality rates of COVID-19 and the seasonal flu, specifically indicating that COVID-19 is rated less fatal than the seasonal flu?		
USA TODAY found the comparison presented in the meme simply with numbers is not a fair one. The novel coronavirus spreads more quickly and is more contagious than the seasonal flu. Fact check: 2009 swine flu spread rapidly, but COVID-19 is more deadly We rate this claim as PARTLY FALSE, based on our research. The initial claim presented mostly accurate statistics for the flu epidemic in 1918 and seasonal flu mortality rates. But COVID-19 has been deadlier than either of these diseases, according to experts and studies. Though the number of people dead from COVID-19 as a percentage of world population at one point in time may be an accurate number, it is not reflective of the mortality rate of the virus.
		

Has the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention officially released any statements or reports comparing the fatality rates of COVID-19 and the seasonal flu, specifically indicating that COVID-19 is rated less fatal than the seasonal flu?		
A comparison of coronavirus and seasonal influenza CFRs may have been intended during Congressional testimony, but due to misclassifying an IFR as a CFR, the comparison turned out to be between an adjusted coronavirus CFR of 1% and an influenza IFR of 0.1%. Had the adjusted coronavirus mortality rate not been lowered from 3% to 1%, fatality comparisons of the coronavirus to the IFR of seasonal influenza would have increased from 10-times higher to 20- to 30-times higher. By then, epidemiologists might have been alerted to the possibility of a miscalculation in such an alarming estimation. Most people rely on trusted public health experts from organizations like the CDC to disseminate vital information on infectious diseases.26 Unfortunately, even experts can make simple miscalculations that can lead to catastrophic results.
		

Has the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention officially released any statements or reports comparing the fatality rates of COVID-19 and the seasonal flu, specifically indicating that COVID-19 is rated less fatal than the seasonal flu?		
On average, the CDC estimates of deaths attributed to influenza were nearly 6 times greater than its reported counted numbers. Conversely, COVID-19 fatalities are at present being counted and reported directly, not estimated. As a result, the more valid comparison would be to compare weekly counts of COVID-19 deaths to weekly counts of seasonal influenza deaths. During the week ending April 21, 2020, 15 455 COVID-19 counted deaths were reported in the US.5 The reported number of counted deaths from the previous week, ending April 14, was 14 478. By contrast, according to the CDC, counted deaths during the peak week of the influenza seasons from 2013-2014 to 2019-2020 ranged from 351 (2015-2016, week 11 of 2016) to 1626 (2017-2018, week 3 of 2018).6
		

Has the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention officially released any statements or reports comparing the fatality rates of COVID-19 and the seasonal flu, specifically indicating that COVID-19 is rated less fatal than the seasonal flu?		
This is not the percentage of deaths from seasonal flu in the whole population, as that would be far lower. However, CFR (as with most epidemiological statistics) heavily relies on confirmed cases and deaths and may not accurately reflect the total picture within the population due to unreported cases and subsequent deaths. CFR can vary considerably for the same disease across different cities and countries. Much of this can depend on the population's characteristics – such as average age, as well as access to robust and free healthcare systems, levels of previous immunity (e.g. vaccinations), and treatment strategies. The infection fatality rate (IFR) refers to the proportion of people being infected by a disease-causing agent (in the case of COVID-19, the SARS-CoV-2 virus), including asymptomatic and undiagnosed infections (such as in care homes), who die from the disease; and is much lower than the CFR.

Is there any scientific evidence or research that supports the claim that consuming millets can protect against the Coronavirus or reduce the severity of COVID-19?		
Dietary surveys in the US and elsewhere show that most people are consuming diets that do not meet national guidelines—often because of availability or cost—and such diets may not provide optimal quantities of essential vitamins and minerals. Currently, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is likely to put many more individuals at risk of food insecurity and make consuming a healthy diet even more difficult. This becomes increasingly likely if the infection risk-mitigation strategies do not include approaches to ensure essential supplies are effectively distributed and accessible, or if the pandemic affects productivity of the agricultural sector. Although we are not aware of good data on the effects of nutritional supplements on risk or severity of COVID-19, existing evidence indicates that supplements of several nutrients can reduce risk or severity of some viral infections, particularly among people with inadequate dietary sources.

Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections The Russian government interfered in the 2016 United States elections with the goals of sabotaging the presidential campaign of Hillary Clinton, boosting the presidential campaign of Donald Trump, and increasing political and social discord in the United States. According to the U.S. intelligence community, the operation—code named Project Lakhta[3][4]—was ordered directly by Russian president Vladimir Putin.[5][6] The 448-page Mueller report, made public in April 2019, examined over 200 contacts between the Trump campaign and Russian officials but concluded that there was insufficient evidence to bring any conspiracy or coordination charges against Trump or his associates.

In addition, 39% of respondents felt that Trump ""should be impeached"", while 49% said that he should not.[518] On December 15, 2016, Hillary Clinton said she partially attributed her loss in the 2016 election to Russian meddling organized by Putin.[520] Clinton said Putin had a personal grudge against her. She linked Putin's feelings about her to her criticism of the 2011 Russian legislative election, adding that he felt she was responsible for fomenting the 2011–13 Russian protests.[519] Clinton drew a specific connection from her 2011 assertions as U.S. Secretary of State that Putin rigged the Russian elections that year to his efforts to influence the 2016 U.S. elections.[521] During the third presidential debate, Clinton had stated that Putin favored Trump ""because he'd rather have a puppet as president of the United States"".[522] Clinton said that by personally attacking her through meddling in the election, Putin attacked the American democratic system.[520] She said the Russian cyberattacks did not just affect her candidacy, but were an attempt to attack the national security of the United States.[519] Clinton acknowledged that she was unsuccessful in sufficiently publicizing to the media the cyberattacks against her campaign in the months leading up to the election.[521]

The Internet Research Agency (IRA), based in Saint Petersburg, Russia, and described as a troll farm, created thousands of social media accounts that purported to be Americans supporting radical political groups and planned or promoted events in support of Trump and against Clinton. They reached millions of social media users between 2013 and 2017. Fabricated articles and disinformation were spread from Russian government-controlled media, and promoted on social media. Additionally, computer hackers affiliated with the Russian military intelligence service (GRU) infiltrated information systems of the Democratic National Committee (DNC), the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC), and Clinton campaign officials, notably chairman John Podesta, and publicly released stolen files and emails through DCLeaks, Guccifer 2.0, and WikiLeaks during the election campaign.

245,Potential voter fraud in the 2020 U.S Presidential Election is caused by mail-in ballots being sent to a mans  deceased parents in Mercer County in New Jersey.,"Did any investigation or official report confirm that mail-in ballots were sent to deceased individuals in Mercer County, New Jersey, during the 2020 U.S. Presidential Election, and if so, how many ballots were affected and were there any instances of fraud related to these ballots?		
Voter fraud in the U.S. is historically rare, according to multiple studies and statistics. Nearly 1 in 4 voters cast ballots in the 2016 presidential election via mail. Still, New Jersey has had issues with mail-in voting this year. Some voters received the wrong ballots in the mail and some results took weeks to become official. Also, about 1 in 10 people who mailed in ballots in May’s special elections had their votes rejected. And there were allegations of voter fraud in the Paterson City Council race in May. State Attorney General Gurbir Grewal filed voting fraud charges against a city councilman and a councilman-elect.

This comes despite extreme opposition to widespread mail-in voting from President Donald Trump, as well as from other Republicans and some county officials in New Jersey, who warn about the potential for voter fraud. It also comes after New Jersey’s attorney general filed voter fraud charges against candidates in Paterson related to an all-mail-in election earlier this year. Plus, there’s concern over how the U.S. Postal Service will handle mail-in voting this fall. It was revealed later Friday that the agency sent New Jersey and other states a warning letter that it can’t guarantee all mail-in ballots will be delivered in time to be counted. One New Jersey congressman wants the state attorney general to conduct a criminal probe into Trump and the postmaster general for “interfering” with state elections.

President Trump has sent at least eight tweets since September about what he calls “unsolicited ballots”, warning that states are sending “80 million unsolicited ballots to voters” and that “the Unsolicited Mail In Ballot Scam is a major threat to our Democracy, & the Democrats know it.” Others report receiving ballots for dead relatives, like Twitter user Carolyn Quinn, who posted a picture on October 6 of mail-in ballots from New Jersey that were meant for her deceased parents with the caption: “VOTER FRAUD ALERT!”. Quinn told the FRANCE 24 Observers that her parents both passed away around one year ago, and provided court documents attesting to the fact. VOTER FRAUD ALERT!

'Voter Fraud Alert!' - US voters post photos of their unsolicited mail-in ballots online This year’s US presidential election will see unprecedented numbers of Americans sending in their ballots by mail due to the coronavirus pandemic. However, as states moved to expand voting by mail, President Trump and his supporters have cast doubt on the integrity of mail-in ballots, particularly “universal mail-in voting” where states automatically send ballots to all registered and active voters. In recent weeks, voters have been expressing concern on social media after receiving mail-in ballots for people who have moved or passed away.

Meanwhile, Thomas Marshall, the Postal Service’s general counsel and executive vice president, sent New Jersey’s secretary of state a letter July 30 saying that “certain deadlines for requesting and casting mail-in ballots are incongruous with the Postal Service’s delivery standards.” That creates a “significant risk” a ballot could be requested and returned too late to be counted, Marshall said. Still, some of his concerns involved residents requesting to vote absentee, which won’t be necessary because everyone will automatically be sent a ballot. Plus, the state is giving a week for clerks to receive ballots after Election Day.

There has been at least one instance of targeted mail-in ballot fraud this year, Dr. Atkeson said: “Mail-in voting is not filled with fraud, but the fraud that we find is targeted in places where election results are going to be close. An example of this is a municipal election earlier this year in Paterson, New Jersey that was overturned after charges of mail-in voter fraud caused nearly 20 percent of the ballots to be rejected. It would be very difficult to orchestrate some kind of national election fraud. But the fear in universal mail-in voting is that you’re creating more opportunity for mischief and losing chain of custody for ballots.”

The number of states mailing ballots to all registered voters has also doubled, going from five in 2016 to 10 this year. The New York Times has reported that ballot request data indicates that more Democrats than Republicans are likely to vote by mail in 2020. “It would be very difficult to orchestrate some kind of national election fraud”To understand whether mistaken mail-in ballots could lead to significant election fraud, the FRANCE 24 Observers team spoke to professors Lonna Atkeson of the University of New Mexico and Trey Hood of the University of Georgia, both specialists in election administration. Dr. Hood said that erroneously sent ballots are only a threat if someone tries to use them to vote:

“As much as we enjoy the time-honored traditions of joining our neighbors on line to cast our ballots on Election Day, and as much as we are energized by seeking packed polling places, we must recognize that this is not a regular election year,” Murphy, a Democrat, said Friday during his latest coronavirus briefing in Trenton. Here’s what you need to know about the new voting setup: Every active registered voter will automatically receive a ballot with prepaid postage in the mail. Usually, you have to request a ballot to vote by mail in New Jersey. But under this order, county clerks must mail ballots with prepaid postage to all of the state’s approximately 6.2 million registered voters by Oct. 5.

A total of 37 people in East China's Jiangsu Province have been diagnosed with Severe Fever with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome (SFTS) this year, a disease caused by the novel bunya virus which is spread by ticks. Experts have warned that the virus can be transmitted from person to person. Based on previous cases, the virus can be transmitted from infected animals or people to others via blood, respiratory tract and wounds, Sheng Jifang, an expert on the novel bunya virus and director of the infectious disease department with the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine, told the Global Times on Wednesday. Sheng mentioned that a patient who was infected with the novel bunya virus three years ago and died later had infected 16 people that had contact with the patient's dead body as the patient had bleeding because of severe infection.

Due to advances in genomic and virus identification approaches, novel bunyaviruses have been discovered and identified as important causes of human disease during recent years (1,–3). One example is severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) virus, a new member of the family Bunyaviridae, genus Phlebovirus (1, 4). The virus was first isolated in China in 2009 from patients presenting with a hemorrhagic fever illness (1, 5). The initial case fatality rate reported for SFTS was 12 to 30%, and a recent serosurvey among persons living in rural Jiangsu Province found that 3.6% of residents had neutralizing antibodies to SFTS virus (6).

Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) is a tick-borne emerging infectious disease caused by a novel bunyavirus, SFTS virus (SFTSV). Since first discovered in China in 2011, SFTSV has been detected from SFTS patients and ticks with expanding geographic ranges from China to Japan and South Korea. The potential for SFTS spread to other warm or sub-tropical regions makes it a serious concern to the public health. It is of great importance to detect SFTSV rapidly and specifically for the effective control of the disease.

However, as we explain here, the total number of cases of COVID-19 is not known. One big reason for this is that not everyone with COVID-19 is tested.8,9 The total number of cases is not known, so the IFR cannot be simply calculated from observed data. But, researchers are able to estimate the total number of cases and use that to calculate the IFR – we get to this further below.

Not everyone is tested for COVID-19, so the total number of cases is higher than the number of confirmed cases. Whenever there are cases of the disease that are not counted, the probability of dying from the disease is lower than the reported case fatality rate. Remember our imaginary scenario with 10 deaths and 100 cases. The CFR in that example is 10% – but if there actually 500 cases (and we’ve simply missed 400 of them due to lack of testing), then the real risk (the IFR) is just 2%. Or to summarize in one sentence. If the number of total cases is higher than the number of confirmed cases, then the ratio between deaths and total cases is smaller than the ratio between deaths and confirmed cases.12

But it’s important to note that it is the ratio between the number of confirmed deaths from the disease and the number of confirmed cases, not total cases. That means that it is not the same as – and, in fast-moving situations like COVID-19, probably not even very close to – the true risk for an infected person. Another important metric, which should not be confused with the CFR, is the crude mortality rate. The “crude mortality rate” is another very simple measure which, like the CFR, gives something that might sound like the answer to the question “if someone is infected, how likely are they to die?”.

AARP policy prohibits employees or officers from engaging in any personal political activity using AARP resources or during work hours. According to campaign finance data tracked by Open Secrets, individual donors associated with AARP made a total of $96,381 in political contributions as of this writing in the 2020 federal election cycle, the majority (87.45%) of those donations going to Democratic candidates. Massoglia said that as a 501(c)4 organization, the AARP is allowed under U.S. tax code to engage in some political campaign activity. But their activities have been issue-oriented and bipartisan. For example, a 2018 AARP ad praised U.S. President Donald Trump on drug pricing policy.

More: Fact check: No, Joel Osteen’s megachurch isn’t charging for online prayer requests The Federal Elections Commission, which works to enforce campaign finance law and tracks political donations, does not have any listings for an AARP PAC. While AARP itself does not — and cannot — make political donations, the company's ""rank-and-file employees have the right to give (political donations),"" Young said. Open Secrets — which tracks political donations made by individuals — shows that employees at AARP have donated $96,381 in the 2020 election cycle, most of which went to Democratic candidates.

“Apparently, AARP believes what their members don’t know won’t hurt them,” observed AFA vice president Buddy Smith. Smith said due to its doublespeak in the media and its clandestine endorsement of Obamacare, AARP can by no means be considered trustworthy. By endorsing Obamacare and the insurance particulars that would necessarily follow, AARP has set itself up to monopolize a market and make a profit upwards of $1 billion over the next decade. This monopolization is evidenced by a report released by members of the House Ways and Means Committee.
		

Has the AARP publicly endorsed President Biden and provided financial support to Planned Parenthood?		
A reported 71 pages of emails were exchanged between AARP and the White House. These emails demonstrated AARP “scripting the president’s talking points, working to keep its board in line and pledging fealty to ‘the cause.’” On October 4, just days after these emails were exposed, Huffington Post ran a story that again revealed the inconsistency in AARP. In the presidential debate that had occurred the night before, President Barack Obama had named AARP among supporters for his health care plan. In response, AARP issued a statement again claiming its nonpartisanship and reiterated its desire not to be associated with a particular candidate or campaign.
		

Has the AARP publicly endorsed President Biden and provided financial support to Planned Parenthood?		
The statement said, “While we respect the rights of each campaign to make its case to voters, AARP has never consented to the use of its name by any candidate or political campaign. AARP is a nonpartisan organization, and we do not endorse political candidates nor coordinate with any candidate or political party.” Really? Only weeks before, as Wall Street Journal pointed out, the email trail between AARP and the White House illustrated an obvious partisan alliance. In one of these emails concerning an invitation to advocate Obamacare publicly, then AARP representative John Rother declined, saying, “Polling shows we are more influential when we are seen as independent.”

In mid-August 2020, Snopes readers inquired about a meme circulating on Facebook that claimed money given to AARP (formerly American Association of Retired Persons), an advocacy organization that lobbies on behalf of retired Americans, goes ""directly"" to the Democratic party. It's unclear what exactly is meant by the phrase, ""what you pay AARP."" The organization has an estimated 38 million members, all of whom typically pay annual dues at $16 per year. As a 501(c)4 tax-exempt organization, it also accepts charitable donations. Either way, any money paid to AARP through membership dues or donations does not go ""directly"" to the Democratic party.

When we heard SPB diving deep in the notes of the song, we could feel the passion of the protagonist for whom indeed the woman was “nidura mabbulanu merupu teegavai kalalu repinadi” (Who, like a streak of lightning warded off clouds of stupor) and “bratuku veenapai pranayaragamunu alapinchinadi” (who sang the melody of intimacy to the Veena that is life). What made and makes this song truly special and begs one to believe that it was sung for them was the immersion that was rare to come; just as the writer kicks the protagonist deep into the whirlpool of feeling, so is SPB in the whirlpool of song. SP Balasubrahmanyam could not be, for too long, a singer of melodies only, with the voice of a husky adolescent. That would not make him the ‘top’ singer.

This underreporting is largely due to missing information on death certificates, which may result in misclassification of intent.

Intent category averages may not total to yearly average due to rounding.

""If someone wants to try something, fine. I'm ready for them. I'm focused on the people of New Zealand, I'm not worrying about the sort of muckrakers we've dealt with in the past."" Need a reminder of what Collins has dished up in the past? Below are the biggest controversies of her political career. Judith Collins was accused in 2014 of a conflict of interest with Oravida bosses - a company where her husband was a director - and a Chinese official. During a taxpayer-funded visit to China in her role as Justice Minister in 2013, Collins was welcomed into the New Zealand export company and endorsed the milk it produced.
		

Does Judith Collins have a direct financial or personal connection to Oravida, and has she publicly stated her opposition to new environmental legislation on this basis?		
One of the directors of Oravida is National MP Judith Collins' husband, David Wong-Tung. The argument is that Oravida is exporting them to China under the guise of being tables and the money is being funneled into their political affiliations which just happen to include the political party Wong-Tung's wife (Judith Collins) is a prominent member of: National. This was of course denied, and RNZ even [had to write an apology to Oravida] (https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/276363/minister-defends-trade-in-kauri-swamp-logs) at the bottom of their article, saying that they were wrong to suggest Oravida were involved in the export of illegal swamp kauri. FYI.org.nz reports that the OIA request for Judith Collins to speak to her involvement was denied. You can follow the link to see the fuckery used to avoid fulfilling the request.

NZ Cabinet Minister, Judith Collins, has dug a hole for herself by not being very transparent about her relationship and meetings in China with the Chinese-owned milk company Oravida. Once seriously considered as a probable successor to Prime Minister John Key, she now has revealed another rather ugly side to her persona and skittled her chance for some time to come I would think.

Justice Minister Judith Collins has been accused of potentially breaching conflict of interest rules for Cabinet ministers after a visit to a company her husband is a director of while in China. One News reported that while Ms Collins was in China last October she visited the offices of Oravida, a New Zealand company which exports milk products to China. Her husband, David Wong Tung, is a director of Oravida and the company later put up a photo of Ms Collins claiming she had tasted and endorsed their products. It is against Cabinet Manual rules to endorse any product. Labour MP Grant Robertson said there was a perception of a conflict of interest.

The pair's close personal ties to Judith Collins caused a huge political controversy in 2014. They've now expanded from Scampi and milk, to water from a plant in the Bay of Plenty it bought for an undisclosed sum last year. Oravida has a consent to 146 million litres of ground water a year and the regional council says Oravida pays an annual compliance charge of around $500.

All the directors are some variation of the above. Amazingly, DOC signed off on them leaving the landscape in this state. Another of the associated companies is Kauri Ruakaka Ltd, the company which caused a national fuel crisis by indiscriminately digging up the ground in Northland looking for swamp kauri to export to China. Through an allegedly torturous process many of the Oravida directors are also associated with the Shanghai Pengxin buy-out of Crafar farms (now Theland), which is one of the biggest dairy farm groups in NZ. And of course Judith Collins herself was neck deep in the Oravida dairy milk scandal. In winter, cows often produce mud.

Stone Shi and Julia Xu are the brains behind Oravida, and part of [then] Prime Minister John Key's delegation in Beijing. They're now exporting Kiwi water to China as a premium product… Oravida’s history of political donations to the National party and as Newshub puts it, the ‘close personal ties’ that existed between Shi, Xu and National MP Judith Collins caused a huge political controversy in 2014. Evidently, that episode did not derail Oravida’s economic ventures here:

She also fought efforts to ensure that all women have access to contraceptives. Barrett has been critical of Roe v. Wade, stating that the framework of Roe essentially permitted abortion on demand.

Today, President Trump nominated Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court — a jurist with a written track record of disagreeing with the Court’s decision to uphold the Affordable Care Act. Vote like your health care is on the ballot — because it is. https://t.co/TDBQOVLP4K In 2017, she criticised conservative Chief Justice John Roberts’ vote to uphold a key component of the Affordable Care Act, arguing that he pushed the act “beyond its plausible meaning to save the statute” when it came to a fee required of those who choose to not have health insurance. She wrote a dissenting opinion last year against a federal law that bars felons, including those who did not commit violent crimes, from owning guns.
		

What specific cases or opinions has Amy Coney Barrett authored or joined that express her disagreement with the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision to uphold the Affordable Care Act?		
Since Donald Trump and the Republican-controlled Senate made Amy Coney Barrett a federal judge on the Seventh Circuit in 2017, she has not disappointed them. As reported in People For the American Way’s Confirmed Judges, Confirmed Fears series, Barrett has been a reliable vote to deny people their legal rights in areas such as health care, racial equity, criminal justice, immigrants’ rights, and the rights of working people. This report focuses on divided Seventh Circuit decisions in which other judges have dissented from harmful rulings Barrett has written or joined, or in which she has dissented to try to push the law further to the right. Before she was a judge, Barrett sharply criticized the Supreme Court for upholding the Affordable Care Act’s individual mandate, and she agreed with Justice Scalia’s dissent in King v. Burwell that “the statute known as Obamacare should be renamed ‘SCOTUScare’ in honor of the Court’s willingness to ‘rewrite’ the statute in order to keep it afloat.”

Barrett also argued in another dissenting opinion in favour of Trump administration rules that make it more difficult for people who are likely to rely on public benefits to attain a green card. Amy Coney Barrett will work to gut Roe v. Wade and the ACA, taking away health care coverage from millions of Americans—including those with pre-existing conditions. And make no mistake: Trump is counting on her to swing the Supreme Court in his favor when he loses this election. While Barrett’s stance on abortion rights remains more opaque, many anti-abortion organisations see her as a top pick for overturning Roe v Wade, the landmark 1973 Supreme Court ruling that federally guarantees the right to abortion access without excessive governmental barriers.

Toward the end of her review, however, Barrett does single out two cases — NFIB v. Sebelius (2012) and King v. Burwell (2015) — and suggests the courts should have taken a more aggressive approach in those decisions. Both NFIB and King largely rejected partisan attacks on the Affordable Care Act. In NFIB, Judge Barrett writes, “Chief Justice Roberts pushed the Affordable Care Act beyond its plausible meaning to save the statute.” Likewise, Barrett appears to endorse Justice Scalia’s dissenting opinion in King, which attacks the majority for its supposed willingness to “rewrite” Obamacare in order to save it.

Add your name to our petition in opposition and join the dissent. Coney Barrett has demonstrated hostility toward LGBTQ rights in her words and rulings, criticizing key decisions and hard-fought wins for our community including defending the minority opinion in Obergefell v. Hodges and questioning transgender people’s rights under federal law. She has also said Roe v. Wade was an “erroneous decision” and questioned the validity of the Affordable Care Act, which the Court will consider once again post-election. While Coney Barrett’s record does enough raise serious concerns about her ability to be impartial and fair to all, including LGBTQ people, it’s the undemocratic confirmation process that makes this an obvious effort to dramatically shift the balance of the Court.

In a 2017 Notre Dame Law School article, Barrett quoted from Justice Antonin Scalia, who protested 2012 and 2015 rulings upholding core provisions of the law and lamented that Obamacare should be renamed “SCOTUScare.” Barrett’s scholarly writings are giving fuel to Democratic arguments that her appointment could upend health coverage for 20 million Americans.

President Trump’s nominee will receive a vote on the floor of the United States Senate.” Sept. 18, 2020 No. “The American people should have a voice in the selection of their next Supreme Court justice. Therefore, this vacancy should not be filled until we have a new president.” “Rarely does a Supreme Court vacancy occur in the final year of a presidential term … Given that we are in the midst of the presidential election process, we believe that the American people should seize the opportunity to weigh in.” Unclear.

Has a Supreme Court nominee ever been nominated and confirmed during an election year in which the presidential election is already underway?		
Yes. “In the more than two dozen vacancies on the U.S. Supreme Court during a presidential election year in our nation’s history, the sitting president made a nomination in every single case. Leader McConnell has said that he will hold a vote on any nominee President Trump sends to the Senate, and I intend to fulfill my role as a U.S. senator and judge that nominee based on his or her merits.” No. “During a very partisan year and a presidential election year … both for the sake of the court and the integrity of the court and the legitimacy of the candidate, it’s better to have this occur after we’re past this presidential election.” Yes. “The precedent here is clear. In the case of a united government, with voters having elected a Senate and White House of the same party, it is our constitutional obligation to consider a nomination of a Supreme Court justice.”
		

Has a Supreme Court nominee ever been nominated and confirmed during an election year in which the presidential election is already underway?		
Igor Volsky, a staffer at the liberal Center for American Progress, responded with a tweet listing justices who have been confirmed in election years: Volsky also listed Salmon Chase, Ward Hunt, and William Woods, but their nominations all occurred in December — after the presidential election had already happened — so it's not fair to count them as election-year choices. Liberals, of course, will argue that this shows it would be unprecedented for Senate Republicans to refuse to confirm Obama's choice for the Supreme Court. But notably, 13 out of those 14 nominations occurred prior to World War II. That's significant because American politics — particularly the politics of the Supreme Court — has changed a lot in recent decades.

That is the case in this election year and we should go forward accordingly.” Statement as reported by the KX Network in North Dakota.

If the nominee reaches the Senate floor, I intend to vote based upon their qualifications.” Romney also said that “the historical precedent of election year nominations is that the Senate generally does not confirm an opposing party’s nominee but does confirm a nominee of its own.”

And if the president and the Senate are of different parties for a vacancy during a presidential election year, the Senate does not confirm the nominee. What does history show us? Of the 29 times this has happened, 19 of them, the president and Senate were of the same party, 19 times. The Senate confirmed the nominee 17 of those times. History is clear: You have a president and the Senate of the same party, that nominee’s getting confirmed, assuming they’re qualified.”
		

Has a Supreme Court nominee ever been nominated and confirmed during an election year in which the presidential election is already underway?		
With less than six weeks until the presidential election, the White House is preparing to nominate a new Supreme Court justice, following the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has insisted that the nominee will get a vote. McConnell acted differently in 2016. Justice Antonin Scalia died more than eight months before that year’s presidential election and McConnell said the Senate should not vote on President Barack Obama’s nominee because voters should be given a say by way of choosing the next president. McConnell argues that this year’s vacancy, though closer to the election, is different because Republicans control both the Senate and the White House, whereas the government was divided in 2016.
		

Has a Supreme Court nominee ever been nominated and confirmed during an election year in which the presidential election is already underway?		
Well, history shows us of those 29 times, presidents have made those Supreme Court nominations all 29. It’s absolutely clear. What does a president do if a president has a vacancy during a presidential election year? “By the way, of the 44 individuals who served as the president of the United States, 22 of them – half – have made nominations of Supreme Court justices for vacancies that occurred in a presidential election year. So this is commonplace. So all of the high outrage that the president would nominate someone is silly.”

The maximum benefit under each scheme is 2 lakh rupees, not 4 lakh rupees as mentioned in the post. Hence the claim made in the post is PARTLY TRUE. Two schemes are mentioned in the post.

The former vice president, whose name has come up as a possible Democratic challenger for Trump in 2020, gave a speech described by some as “fiery” at Saturday’s Human Rights Campaign (HRC) dinner. Without mentioning Trump by name, Biden accused anti-LGBTQ individuals of having an “ally” in the White House, and that the “forces of intolerance” use the Oval Office as a “bully pulpit” to marginalize the LGBTQ community and to roll back gains the community has made over the years.

It also excludes judges who are not part of the Federal Judicial Center’s database, such as those appointed to certain specialty or territorial courts. To date, Trump has not changed the historical pattern of GOP presidents appointing fewer minority judges than Democrats. Seven of the 67 judges Trump has appointed, or 10%, are racial or ethnic minorities – the lowest such percentage of any president of either party since George H.W. Bush, whose appointed judges were also 10% nonwhite. Five of the seven racial or ethnic minority judges Trump has successfully appointed are Asian, one is Hispanic (Fernando Rodriguez Jr.) and one is black (Terry Fitzgerald Moorer).
		

Has Donald Trump appointed any black federal judges during his presidency?		
I strongly disagree, as do the NAACP and many other civil rights groups that have worked tirelessly for racial diversity and parity on the federal bench. This is not purely about the Constitution. This is indeed very political. It is also about the conservative, male-dominated preservation of the courts in the hands of conservative white men, more than it is about the “rule of law.” The racial breakdown of Trump’s nominees speaks for itself. None of his 53 confirmed appeals court judges is Black. Not a single one. That makes Donald Trump the first president since Richard Nixon to go a full first term without selecting a Black nominee for a federal appeals court.
		

Has Donald Trump appointed any black federal judges during his presidency?		
Alarmingly, just one of Trump’s 68 federal judge appointees count as African American. Further, Trump has already appointed 26 appeals court judges, which is more than any other president in the first two years of a presidency, according to the Brookings Institution. The significance of federal and appellate court appointments is that presidents can use them to reshape the federal judiciary and seek to appoint judges they believe share their ideological leanings. According to a recent analysis by Reuters, the 13 appellate courts wield considerable power, usually providing the last word on rulings appealed from lower courts on disputes involving federal law.

Unfortunately, any gains in diversity made by previous administrations came to a halt once Trump took office. President Trump is appointing federal judges at a rapid pace, yet his judicial picks are the least racially and ethnically diverse of any presidential administration over the past 30 years. As of August, Trump lagged behind the Obama administration in appointing women by 20 percentage points.35 The current administration’s stunning reshaping of the federal courts undercuts decades-worth of efforts by previous administrations—both Democrat and Republican—to diversify the judiciary.

Donald Trump is on track to be the first president since Richard Nixon to go a full first term without selecting a Black nominee for a federal appeals court. Just one of Trump’s 53 confirmed appeals court judges is Hispanic and none are Black. That compares to about 27% of President Barack Obama’s and roughly 15% under President George W.

265,A mail-in ballot application for voting in the US presidential election which was sent to a deceased grandfather in the State of New Mexico is evidence of potential widespread voter fraud via mail-in ballots.,"How many instances of mail-in ballot applications being sent to deceased individuals have been reported in comparison to the total number of mail-in ballots processed, and what investigations have been conducted to determine if these instances are part of a broader pattern of voter fraud?		
Researchers at UCLA and the University of New Mexico, in conjunction with the Union of Concerned Scientists, concluded that voter fraud is ""not widespread"" and that mail-in ballot fraud is ""very rare."" In Washington, Wyman said each county election office has a ""myriad of electronic and physical security controls,"" adding there is never a time when someone is alone with ballots. Officials also check registrations against the national death index. Penalties for fraud is a felony that could lead to time behind bars. Voters are also able to track their ballot through the mail — and Wyman said election officials are currently building out a more detailed system for voters to improve that experience.

“So no system is completely free of the potential of fraud.” Amber McReynolds, CEO of the National Vote at Home Institute and Coalition, said fraud with mail or absentee ballots is “exceedingly rare.” She pointed to Heritage’s own election fraud database, which has documented 206 cases of fraudulent use of absentee ballots since 1991. For the five states that conduct elections entirely by mail, the database has no such cases in Hawaii and Utah, two in Oregon, five in Colorado and six in Washington.

Over the past 20 years, they write, more than 250 million ballots have been cast by mail nationwide, while there have been just 143 criminal convictions for election fraud related to mail ballots. That averages out to about one case per state every six or seven years, or a fraud rate of 0.00006%. ""Expanding voting by mail will be a challenge in most states in 2020,"" they write. ""But we reiterate: There is no evidence that mail-balloting results in rampant voter fraud, nor that election officials lack the knowledge about how to protect against abuses."" There's also no evidence of the sort of mail-voting interference that U.S. Attorney General William Barr mentioned in a recent New York Times Magazine interview.

Caltech professor of political and computational social science Michael Alvarez explains in this video. A 2020 report from the University of New Mexico's Center for Social Policy, the UCLA Voting Rights Project, and the Union of Concerned Scientists concluded that incidents of mail-in ballot fraud are rare, including in states that have adopted universal vote-by-mail systems. For example, an analysis of 2016 election data in Oregon identified 10 instances of fraudulent ballots out of 2 million votes cast. Similarly, researchers at Caltech have agreed that while mail-in ballots may be more vulnerable to fraud or tampering than ballots cast in person, security measures minimize those risks.

More information about both post-election audits is available. This voting system has accurately counted over 13 million ballots since the 2016 Primary Election. Most mail-in ballots (also called absentee ballots) are delivered by the USPS. If a voter requests an electronically delivered absentee ballot, the ballot is delivered via a secure website. On the website, a voter can choose to print a blank ballot and mark the ballot by hand or mark his or her ballot using an online tool and print the ballot.

Or the harvester can simply discard the ballot if the voter chose the “wrong” candidate. Done effectively, the process is largely invisible to the voter, who is led to believe their ballot was cast according to their wishes. Because of tactics like these, my office has conducted over 300 investigations of mail-in ballot fraud. Our investigators have spoken with thousands of victims of mail ballot fraud over the years, and they commonly tell us they were pressured and harassed by campaign workers to sign up to vote by mail, vote a certain way, or hand over their ballots. The common denominator in mail ballot fraud is that the votes of the victims are cancelled and replaced by those of paid campaign workers.

Voter fraud is very rare, whether people vote in person or by mail. That much is clear from a large body of research. One of us is a political scientist at the University of Washington, and the other is a former elections commissioner who now studies voting laws. We can explain why voter fraud is so rare – especially for mail-in ballots, which have drawn both the interest and concern of many people this year. The goal, of course, is to make sure that ballots received by mail are legitimate – that they are cast by registered voters, not by others lying about their identity, and that each voter casts only one ballot in a single election.

Yes. Voting by mail is a secure system that provides you with more time and flexibility to cast your ballot in case you can’t make it to the polls on Election Day. There is absolutely no evidence of an increase in “voter fraud” with vote by mail. For example, in Oregon, over 100 million mail-in ballots have been cast since 2000. Of those, 0.000012% resulted in fraud (that’s about a dozen total cases in 20 years). In fact, the military has been using vote by mail since the Civil War.

What are the official ballot submission requirements for Pennsylvania, particularly regarding the necessity of outer and inner envelopes for a ballot to be counted?		
Pa. is poised to take an unusually restrictive approach to mail-in ballots A recent state court ruling says Pennsylvania can’t count ballots mailed without a secrecy envelope. The decision makes the state an outlier nationally. A recent court ruling could make Pennsylvania a significant outlier in how it deals with mail-in ballots in the 2020 election — and could mean thousands of votes aren’t counted. Among other things, the ruling handed down from the Democratic-controlled state Supreme Court decided that mail-in ballots should be discarded if they arrive at a county election office without a “secrecy envelope,” sometimes called “naked ballots.”
		

What are the official ballot submission requirements for Pennsylvania, particularly regarding the necessity of outer and inner envelopes for a ballot to be counted?		
“It is a vestige of the past,” she wrote. “The secrecy envelope is a holdover from when Pennsylvania counted absentee ballots at polling places. Now they are counted centrally, through an industrialized process.” The commissioners’ practice was challenged in the 2019 general election, and in the 2020 primary, but each time the group voted to continue tallying ballots that arrived without the secrecy envelope. It’s difficult to know how many ballots could be rejected due to missing secrecy envelopes, both because Pennsylvania drastically expanded mail voting for this year’s election, and because missing envelopes weren’t closely tracked in the past.
		

What are the official ballot submission requirements for Pennsylvania, particularly regarding the necessity of outer and inner envelopes for a ballot to be counted?		
Under Pennsylvania’s mail voting statute, voters are supposed to place their completed ballots inside the smaller secrecy envelope, then put that inside the postmarked envelope that comes with their ballot. It’s a mechanism intended to maintain voters’ privacy after the outer envelopes are removed during vote counting. But it’s one that state and county officials say they never considered particularly essential in the past, and one that’s not commonly used in other states, either. So, exactly how unusual would Pennsylvania’s new approach to secrecy envelopes be?
		

What are the official ballot submission requirements for Pennsylvania, particularly regarding the necessity of outer and inner envelopes for a ballot to be counted?		
“Rejection because of the lack of a secrecy envelope is so rare that the U.S. Election Assistance Commission doesn’t ask about it in their post-election Election Administration and Voting Survey,” he said. Of the sixteen states that require secrecy ballots, several — Florida, New Hampshire, Ohio — are considered competitive in the general election. But Pennsylvania is perhaps the most competitive of all, and the most likely to influence the election’s outcome. Susan Dzieduszycka-Suinat, who heads the voting information nonprofit U.S. Vote Foundation, said she doesn’t think there’s a good reason why ballots can’t be accepted without the secrecy envelope, or why the envelope is necessary at all.
		

What are the official ballot submission requirements for Pennsylvania, particularly regarding the necessity of outer and inner envelopes for a ballot to be counted?		
Only sixteen states legally require these envelopes to be used in the first place. A few others give their counties the option to use them if they want, but they’re not mandatory. Charles Stewart, an MIT political science professor who studies American elections, said it’s difficult to say how those states handle ballots that are returned without secrecy envelopes. Often these decisions are left to counties — as was the case in Pennsylvania until recently — so each individual state might have many ways of handling the issue. But Stewart said a broad-strokes decision like the one now governing Pennsylvania’s process is definitely uncommon.

Health plans are barred from refusing to cover patients with such conditions under the ACA, but the Trump administration backs a court decision that would strike down the entirety of the law as unconstitutional, including such protections. The case is currently before the Supreme Court, with oral arguments set to begin after the election.

It’s unclear if the version announced Thursday will see a different fate.

These are two of Americans’ biggest complaints with the country’s health care system. But neither of these orders will have any immediate effect on the problem at hand.

COVID-19 would likely become a pre-existing condition without protections written into law. In fact before the ACA, having taken hydroxychloroquine in the previous year — a marker for malaria, lupus, or rheumatoid arthritis — could get you excluded from coverage. President Trump has vowed to protect people with pre-existing conditions if the ACA is overturned and recently issued an executive order saying it is the “policy of the United States” to “ensure that Americans with pre-existing conditions can obtain the insurance of their choice at affordable rates.” However, the president’s order carries no force of law, and he has never released a plan to replace the ACA or protect people with pre-existing conditions.

If the Affordable Care Act is struck down in the Supreme Court, as Trump and Republican states are advocating, pre-existing condition protections will mean little in the face of annual limits, the elimination of key essential health benefits like prescription drug coverage, and many other harmful policies that will return.

Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar defended the need for an executive order on pre-existing conditions to reporters on Thursday, pointing to the Supreme Court case. Azar said that the White House wanted to ensure that Americans will be protected even if the ACA is struck down by the Supreme Court. But the executive order appears to fall short of that goal. The order states that protecting pre-existing conditions was ""the policy of the United States"" but did not provide any legislative guarantees that Americans would not lose such protections if the ACA were nixed by the Supreme Court. ""The historic action I’m taking today includes the first-ever executive order to affirm it is the official policy of the United States government to protect patients with pre-existing conditions,"" Trump said.

Armand, I just sent you a pm with info for your Denver friend and asked what you were working on. I should have checked out the forum first! You could also consider making a blue Harvestor silo. Always thought they looked cool, plus you didn't have to climb up into them every day and fork out silage. When we helped fill silo there was a set of tubes on the inside of the silo too so the guy, or in my case, kid could direct the material all around and not have to fork as much, plus, walking around helped pack it better. I don't think silo gas is too much of a problem when filling if it is done all in a day or two. It's after it has started to ferment that is dangerous.

In Breaking Down Data Silos, Harvard Business Review describes the main reasons silos arise: - Structural: when an application is built for a specific use or department and data-sharing isn’t a requirement. - Political: when there’s a sense of proprietorship over a system’s data so it isn’t readily shared with others.

Unlike development banks, the IMF does not lend for specific projects. Following such a request, an IMF staff team holds discussions with the government to assess the economic and financial situation, and the size of the country’s overall financing needs, and agree on the appropriate policy response.

However, the success of PPPs is also dependent on the existence of an appropriate institutional framework. The challenges in this regard are greater in emerging market economies and developing countries, but they are also faced by advanced OECD countries. A PPP program should proceed with caution in the absence of an adequate institutional framework, which should be characterized by political commitment, good governance, government expertise, and effective project appraisal and selection. Victoria has developed a detailed and explicit policy on PPPs, Partnerships Victoria. An emphasis on value for money and the public interest is the key feature of the policy.

279,Premier Daniel Andrews of the state of Victoria in Australia borrowed money from the IMF and now is in default.,"Has Victoria, as a state within Australia, ever been a recipient of financial assistance from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and is it currently in default on any IMF loans?		
For more information on the IMF's Response to COVID-19, click here. The IMF provides financial support for balance of payments needs upon request by its member countries. Unlike development banks, the IMF does not lend for specific projects. Following such a request, an IMF staff team holds discussions with the government to assess the economic and financial situation, and the size of the country’s overall financing needs, and agree on the appropriate policy response. Typically, a country’s government and the IMF must agree on a program of economic policies before the IMF provides lending to the country.
		

Has Victoria, as a state within Australia, ever been a recipient of financial assistance from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and is it currently in default on any IMF loans?		
Once an understanding has been reached on policies and a financing package, a recommendation is made to the IMF’s Executive Board to endorse the country’s policy intentions and extend access to IMF resources. This process can be expedited under the IMF’s Emergency Financing Mechanism. **To note: The PSI and PCI do not provide financial support, but the PSI is a PRGT instrument while the PCI applies to both PRGT and GRA. For information on the IMF’s lending arrangement with countries, click here.
		

Has Victoria, as a state within Australia, ever been a recipient of financial assistance from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and is it currently in default on any IMF loans?		
In acute crisis cases, defaults or restructuring of sovereign debt may become unavoidable. IMF lending aims to give countries breathing room to implement adjustment policies in an orderly manner, which will restore conditions for a stable economy and sustainable growth. These policies will vary depending upon the country’s circumstances. For instance, a country facing a sudden drop in the prices of key exports may need financial assistance while implementing measures to strengthen the economy and widen its export base. A country suffering from severe capital outflows may need to address the problems that led to the loss of investor confidence—perhaps interest rates are too low; the budget deficit and debt stock are growing too fast; or the banking system is inefficient or poorly regulated.
		

Has Victoria, as a state within Australia, ever been a recipient of financial assistance from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and is it currently in default on any IMF loans?		
A country’s commitments to undertake certain policy actions, known as policy conditionality, are in most cases an integral part of IMF lending (see table). This policy program underlying an arrangement is in most cases presented to the Fund’s Executive Board in a “Letter of Intent” and further detailed in a “Memorandum of Understanding”. Progress is typically reviewed by monitoring the implementation of the policy actions. However, for some arrangements, countries can use IMF resources with no or limited conditionality if they have already established their commitment to sound policies (FCL, PLL) or where they are designed for urgent and immediate needs, for instance, because of the transitory and limited nature of the shock or where policy implementation capacity is limited, including due to fragilities (RFI, RCF). A country’s return to economic and financial health ensures that IMF funds are repaid so that they can be made available to other member countries.
		

Has Victoria, as a state within Australia, ever been a recipient of financial assistance from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and is it currently in default on any IMF loans?		
In the absence of IMF financing, the adjustment process for the country could be more abrupt and difficult. For example, if investors are unwilling to provide new financing, the country would have no choice but to adjust—often through a painful compression of government spending, imports and economic activity. IMF financing facilitates a more gradual and carefully considered adjustment. As IMF lending is usually accompanied by a set of corrective policy actions, it also provides a seal of approval that appropriate policies are taking place. The IMF’s various lending instruments are tailored to different types of balance of payments need as well as the specific circumstances of its diverse membership (see table).
		

Has Victoria, as a state within Australia, ever been a recipient of financial assistance from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and is it currently in default on any IMF loans?		
All IMF members are eligible to access the Fund’s resources in the General Resources Account (GRA) on non-concessional terms, but the IMF also provides concessional financial support (currently at zero interest rates through June 2021) through the Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust (PRGT; see IMF Support for Low-Income Countries), which is better tailored to the diversity and needs of low-income countries. Historically, for emerging and advanced market economies in crises, the bulk of IMF assistance has been provided through Stand-By Arrangements (SBAs) to address short-term or potential balance of payments problems. The Standby Credit Facility (SCF) serves a similar purpose for low-income countries. The Extended Fund Facility (EFF) and the corresponding Extended Credit Facility (ECF) for low-income countries are the Fund’s main tools for medium-term support to countries facing protracted balance of payments problems. Their use has increased substantially since the global financial crisis, reflecting the structural nature of some members’ balance of payments problems.

The IMF assists countries hit by crises by providing them financial support to create breathing room as they implement adjustment policies to restore economic stability and growth. It also provides precautionary financing to help prevent and insure against crises. The IMF’s lending toolkit is continuously refined to meet countries’ changing needs. The causes of crises are varied and complex, and can be domestic, external, or both. Domestic factors include inappropriate fiscal and monetary policies, which can lead to large economic imbalances (such as large current account and fiscal deficits and high levels of external and public debt); an exchange rate fixed at an inappropriate level, which can erode competitiveness and lead to persistent current account deficits and loss of official reserves; and a weak financial system, which can create economic booms and busts.

280,False positives and rapid tests put the rate of infection near zero and that there will be no second wave of infections,"What evidence is there to support the assertion that false positives and rapid tests can reduce the rate of infection to near zero and prevent a second wave of infections?		
Ruling out a false positive IgM by testing a second serum - If the acute sample was IgG negative, a second serum can be collected at ≥10 days after the acute sample. If this serum is IgG negative, measles can be ruled out. - If the acute serum was IgG positive, a second serum, collected ≥2 weeks after the acute specimen, can be tested for a significant rise in IgG between paired serum samples.
		

What evidence is there to support the assertion that false positives and rapid tests can reduce the rate of infection to near zero and prevent a second wave of infections?		
- Sub-optimal test sensitivity, false negative results are common, especially when influenza activity is high - Sensitivity of RIDTs to detect influenza B viral antigens is lower than for detection of influenza A viral antigens. - Although specificity is high, false positive results can also occur, especially during times when influenza activity is low. - Some RIDTs distinguish between influenza A or B viruses while others do not. RIDTs that provide results on the type of influenza virus (e.g., influenza A or B virus), do not provide information on influenza A virus subtype
		

What evidence is there to support the assertion that false positives and rapid tests can reduce the rate of infection to near zero and prevent a second wave of infections?		
- Sensitivities of RIDTs are generally approximately 50-70%, but a range of 10-80% has been reported compared to viral culture or RT-PCR. Specificities of RIDTs are approximately 90-95% (range 85-100%). Thus false negative results occur more commonly than false positive results. - Negative results of RIDTs do not exclude influenza virus infection and influenza should still be considered in a patient if clinical suspicion is high based upon history, signs, symptoms and clinical examination. - Collect specimens as early in the illness as possible (ideally less than 4 days from illness onset).
		

What evidence is there to support the assertion that false positives and rapid tests can reduce the rate of infection to near zero and prevent a second wave of infections?		
- Fixed characteristic of a test; generally very high for RIDTs (90-95%) - An RIDT with low specificity will produce positive results in some patients who do not have influenza (false positives ) Interpretation of Rapid Influenza Diagnostic Test Results Proper interpretation of RIDT results is very important for clinical management of patients and for assessing suspected influenza outbreaks.
		

What evidence is there to support the assertion that false positives and rapid tests can reduce the rate of infection to near zero and prevent a second wave of infections?		
In participants that had COVID-19 and were tested one week after symptoms developed, antibody tests detected only 27% to 41% of infections. In week 2 after first symptoms, 64% to 79% of infections were detected, rising to 78% to 88% in week 3. Tests that specifically detected IgG or IgM antibodies were the most accurate and, when testing people from 21 days after first symptoms, they detected 93% of people with COVID-19. Tests gave false positive results for 1% of those without COVID-19.
		

What evidence is there to support the assertion that false positives and rapid tests can reduce the rate of infection to near zero and prevent a second wave of infections?		
- Use of RIDTs for Public Health Purposes to Detect Influenza Outbreaks - Interpretation of Rapid Influenza Diagnostic Test Results Rapid influenza diagnostic tests (RIDTs) are immunoassays that can identify the presence of influenza A and B viral nucleoprotein antigens in respiratory specimens, and display the result in a qualitative way (positive vs. negative) (1). In the United States, a number of RIDTs are commercially available. (See “Table 1: Influenza Virus Testing Methods” and “Table 2: Characteristics of Rapid Influenza Diagnostic Tests”.)
		

What evidence is there to support the assertion that false positives and rapid tests can reduce the rate of infection to near zero and prevent a second wave of infections?		
Below we illustrate results for two different scenarios. If 1000 people were tested for IgG or IgM antibodies during the third week after onset of symptoms and only 20 (2%) of them actually had COVID-19: - 26 people would test positive. Of these, 8 people (31%) would not have COVID-19 (false positive result). - 974 people would test negative. Of these, 2 people (0.2%) would actually have COVID-19 (false negative result).
		

What evidence is there to support the assertion that false positives and rapid tests can reduce the rate of infection to near zero and prevent a second wave of infections?		
A number of factors can influence the results of RIDTs. The accuracy of RIDTs depends largely on the conditions under which they are used. Understanding some basic considerations can minimize being misled by false-positive or false-negative results. - A positive result means that the RIDT detected influenza viral antigen, but does not necessarily mean viable influenza virus is present or that the patient is contagious. - The positive predictive value of an RIDT (the proportion of patients with positive results who have influenza) is highest when influenza activity is high in the population being tested (e.g. community).
		

What evidence is there to support the assertion that false positives and rapid tests can reduce the rate of infection to near zero and prevent a second wave of infections?		
Vaccinated persons may not have an IgM response or it may be transient and not detected depending on timing of specimen collection, therefore a negative IgM test in vaccinated persons suspected of having measles should not be used to rule out the case; RT-PCR testing may be the best method to confirm such cases. If viral testing results are noncontributory, additional serological testing can be performed for highly suspicious cases. Testing for measles-specific IgM from persons with rash and fever can produce false positive IgM results. As discussed above, false negative results can also occur in a previously vaccinated person.
		

What evidence is there to support the assertion that false positives and rapid tests can reduce the rate of infection to near zero and prevent a second wave of infections?		
In a low-prevalence (2%) setting, where antibody testing is used to diagnose COVID-19 in people with symptoms but who have had a negative PCR test, we would anticipate that 1 (1 to 2) case would be missed and 8 (5 to 15) would be falsely positive in 1000 people undergoing IgG or IgM testing in week three after onset of SARS-CoV-2 infection. In a seroprevalence survey, where prevalence of prior infection is 50%, we would anticipate that 51 (46 to 58) cases would be missed and 6 (5 to 7) would be falsely positive in 1000 people having IgG tests during the convalescent phase (21 to 100 days post-symptom onset or post-positive PCR) of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

282,Premier Daniel Andrews of the state of Victoria in Australia sold the rights to water to China.,"Has Premier Daniel Andrews of Victoria, Australia, entered into an agreement or sold the rights to water resources to China?		
Andrews signs new Belt and Road deal with China: 'the right thing to do' Victoria has signed a fresh deal with the Chinese government and its global Belt and Road infrastructure project with Premier Daniel Andrews urging other Australian governments to follow suit. The agreement, signed in Beijing on Wednesday evening, will deepen cooperation between the state and the Communist-ruled country in the key areas of infrastructure, innovation, ageing and trade development. Wednesday’s deal was signed only a few hours after federal Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton questioned whether the Premier’s trade efforts in China were in the “national interest”.
		

Has Premier Daniel Andrews of Victoria, Australia, entered into an agreement or sold the rights to water resources to China?		
In 2018, premier Daniel Andrews signed a memorandum of understanding with China’s national development and reform commission to work together on belt and road initiatives. At the time, Andrews said the agreement was aimed at his massive state infrastructure program. “With the biggest infrastructure program in our state’s history under way, we have the design and delivery skills China is looking for, meaning more jobs and more trade and investment for Victorians,” he said. “In four years we have more than tripled Victoria’s share of Chinese investment in Australia and nearly doubled our exports to China.
		

Has Premier Daniel Andrews of Victoria, Australia, entered into an agreement or sold the rights to water resources to China?		
Mr Andrews defended the deal, which he said would create jobs for Victorians, while encouraging all states and territories to follow his lead. “We need a strong partnership, Victoria has one, and we would hope that every state and territory and indeed the Commonwealth would have a strong partnership and a friendship with China,” Mr Andrews said last October. The BRI deal will see a number of areas of co-operation between the Victorian Government and Chinese companies, including Victoria’s massive $107 billion infrastructure spend, collaboration in high-end manufacturing, biotech and agriculture technology. Premier Andrews also said the agreement would give Victorian firms “inside running” on infrastructure projects in China and BRI projects around the world.

In the face of recent public criticism of the state signing on, when the commonwealth did not, he defended his decision by citing trade data. Over the last five years, exports to China have increased by 62%, tourists visiting Victoria increased by 70%, and the number of international students from China had grown by 50%.

This will be good for consumers. But it’s not quite that straightforward. For a start the 5,500 Gigawatt hours of renewable Sout Island hydro-electricity – 13 percent of national demand - that will be released will need $650 million and seven years of transmission upgrades to get it to market.

284,Former US vice-president Joe Biden is showing pretty severe signs of dementia.,"Has there been any recent, credible medical evaluation or diagnosis by qualified healthcare professionals that confirms Joe Biden is showing severe signs of dementia?		
Former Vice President Joe Biden opened up about his lifelong struggle with stuttering on Wednesday, offering a rare lengthy and personal reflection on how it has affected him, even to this day. Biden said at a CNN town hall Wednesday he “still occasionally, when I find myself really tired,” catches himself stuttering. “It has nothing to do with your intelligence quotient. It has nothing to do with your intellectual makeup,” Biden said. He said he thinks “part of it’s confidence” and that he has to “think in terms of not rushing.”
		

Has there been any recent, credible medical evaluation or diagnosis by qualified healthcare professionals that confirms Joe Biden is showing severe signs of dementia?		
His verbal stumbles have voters worried about his mental fitness. Maybe they’d be more understanding if they knew he’s still fighting a stutter. His eyes fall to the floor when I ask him to describe it. We’ve been tiptoeing toward it for 45 minutes, and so far, every time he seems close, he backs away, or leads us in a new direction. There are competing theories in the press, but Joe Biden has kept mum on the subject. I want to hear him explain it. I ask him to walk me through the night he appeared to lose control of his words onstage.

MRI and CT scan also can show evidence of strokes from vascular dementia. Single photon emission CT (SPECT) and PET scan can help identify several forms of dementia, including vascular dementia and frontotemporal dementia. In some cases, electrical activity in the brain may be measured using an electroencephalogram (EEG). Doctors seldom use this test to diagnose dementia. But they may use it to distinguish dementia from delirium and to look for unusual brain activity found in Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, a rare cause of dementia.

“Biden allows that to happen by not naming it for what it is,” she said, though she’s not sure that his presidential candidacy would benefit if he were more forthcoming. “I think he’s dug himself into a hole of not saying that he still stutters for so long that it would strike people as a little weird.” Biden has presented the same life story for decades. He’s that familiar face—Uncle Joe. He was born 11 months after Pearl Harbor and grew up in the last era of definitive “good guys” and “bad guys.” He’s the dependable guy, the tenacious guy, the aviators-and-crossed-arms guy. That guy doesn’t stutter; that guy used to stutter.
		

Has there been any recent, credible medical evaluation or diagnosis by qualified healthcare professionals that confirms Joe Biden is showing severe signs of dementia?		
“So far, he’s called you ‘Sleepy Joe.’ Is ‘St-St-St-Stuttering Joe’ next?” “I don’t think so,” Biden says, “because if you ask the polls ‘Does Biden stutter? Has he ever stuttered?,’ you’d have 80 to 95 percent of people say no.” If Trump goes there, Biden adds, “it’ll just expose him for what he is.” I ask Biden something else we’ve been circling: whether he worries that people would pity him if they thought he still stuttered.

Doctors also might use an electroencephalogram (EEG), a test that records patterns of electrical activity in the brain, to check for abnormal electrical brain activity. - Brain scans—Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can detect structural abnormalities and rule out other causes of dementia. Positron-emission tomography (PET) can look for patterns of altered brain activity that are common in dementia. Advances in PET can detect amyloid plaques and tau tangles in AD.

After he speaks, Biden typically walks offstage to Bruce Springsteen’s “We Take Care of Our Own,” then saunters down the rope line for handshakes and hugs and selfies. One voter after another tells me they’re unaware of Biden’s stutter. “Knowing that he has had something like that to deal with and overcame it, as well as other really sad things that have happened—it just makes me like him more,” says 70-year-old Grace Payne. Back in New York, I start to wonder if I’m forcing Biden into a box where he doesn’t belong. My box. Could I be jealous that his present stutter is less obvious than mine? That he can go sentences at a time without a single block or repetition? Even the way I’m writing this piece—keeping Biden’s stammers, his ums and pauses, on the page—seems hypocritical.
		

Has there been any recent, credible medical evaluation or diagnosis by qualified healthcare professionals that confirms Joe Biden is showing severe signs of dementia?		
Yet even when sharing these old, hard stories, Biden regularly characterizes stuttering as “the best thing that ever happened” to him. “Stuttering gave me an insight I don’t think I ever would have had into other people’s pain,” he says. I admire his empathy, even if I disagree with his strict adherence to a tidy redemption narrative. In Biden’s office, as my time is about to run out, I bring up the fact that Trump crudely mocked a disabled New York Times reporter during the 2016 campaign.
		

Has there been any recent, credible medical evaluation or diagnosis by qualified healthcare professionals that confirms Joe Biden is showing severe signs of dementia?		
You can watch videos posted by his campaign in which Biden meets young stutterers and encourages them to follow his lead. They’re sweet clips, even if the underlying message—beat it or bust—is out of sync with the normalization movement. Emma Alpern is a 32-year-old copy editor who co-leads the Brooklyn chapter of the National Stuttering Association and co-founded NYC Stutters, which puts on a day-long conference for stuttering destigmatization. Alpern told me that she’s on a group text with other stutterers who regularly discuss Biden, and that it’s been “frustrating” to watch the media portray Biden’s speech impediment as a sign of mental decline or dishonesty.
		

Has there been any recent, credible medical evaluation or diagnosis by qualified healthcare professionals that confirms Joe Biden is showing severe signs of dementia?		
“Anger, rage, humiliation,” he says. His speech becomes staccato. “A feeling of, uh—like I’m sure you’ve experienced—it just drops out of your chest, just, like, you feel … a void.” He lifts his hands up to his face like he did on the debate stage in July, to guide the v sound out of his mouth: void. By all accounts, Biden was both popular and a strong athlete in high school. He was class president at Archmere Academy, in Claymont, Delaware. His nickname was “Dash”—not a reference to his speed on the football field, but rather another way to mock his stutter.

Newsom signs legislation changing sex offender law in California California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) signed legislation changing the state’s sex offender law to allow judges to have a say on whether to list someone as a sex offender for having oral or anal sex with a minor. The bill expands discretion already granted to judges to decide if a man should be on California’s sex offender registry, but the existing discretion had applied only to a man who had vaginal intercourse, The Associated Press reported.

Other measures make it easier for offenders to get their records cleared and ensure they can serve on juries after they are released. Newsom said the bills “give hope to those that have earned a second chance in our communities, and also support victims of crime.

But since taking office in January 2019, the governor has attempted to stop at least 33 parole cases wherein a “serious offender” has been granted release, according to documents provided by the governor’s office. “Parole hearings usually take place in front of a two-person panel,” explained Newsom’s spokesman, Brian Ferguson.

Newsom’s decision to sign the legislation promises to have both a state and national political impact. Along with opposition from Republicans in the state Legislature, supporters of President Trump and far-right conspiracy theorists have seized on the bill in an attempt to use the measure as a political wedge issue and rallying cry, with some falsely claiming on social media that California is legalizing pedophilia.

I have plenty of gay friends, each of which I love and respect, but when societal views interfere with our religious freedoms and retainment of morals, I feel a responsibility to object.

So long as Church and State remain separate, no Mormon bishop will ever be forced to conduct a same sex marriage.

Anything else is grounds for violation of Covenants ( a two way promise/ commitment in relationship with Jesus Christ’s Gospel principles) But society DOESN’T fully accept gay marriage. The bigotry that Mormons experience is a direct result of the bigotry they impose upon advocates of gay marriage. Mormons fighting gay marriage with their non-taxed temple money is well-documented.

What specific statements or actions by Black Lives Matter explicitly indicate their intention to destroy the nuclear family?		
The organization BLM is committed to “disrupt the Western-prescribed nuclear family structure.” According to the Oxford English dictionary, “A nuclear family is a family where father, mother and their children live in one household.” To most of us, that’s a good thing. Countless studies show that those growing up in nuclear families have tremendous advantages from healthy, emotionally supportive, educationally enriched, and economically stable upbringings. Yet Black Lives Matter says they are working against this. Ironically, the breakdown of the nuclear family has already brought remarkable hurt to our country, and it has taken a particularly large toll on blacks.

What specific statements or actions by Black Lives Matter explicitly indicate their intention to destroy the nuclear family?		
Critics of Black Lives Matter point to some of the statements on its website, including that it says ""we disrupt the Western-prescribed nuclear family structure.” Black Lives Matter’s full statements about family show that it wants people to support one another broadly beyond the nuclear family. Black Lives Matter also calls for family-friendly spaces and equal rights for mothers. Black Lives Matter has been derided as a terrorist organization (a claim we rated False), a Marxist movement (we found little evidence) and as anti-Semitic (despite some concerns, hundreds of Jewish organizations support it, we found).
		

What specific statements or actions by Black Lives Matter explicitly indicate their intention to destroy the nuclear family?		
To save and enrich black lives, Black Lives Matter must recognize the overwhelming contemporary evidence which proves that deviations from the nuclear family are detrimental to children—not revel in the pride of being “trained Marxists.” 2 thoughts on “Dear Black Lives Matter: What is the alternative to the nuclear family?” There is a far, far more serious problem with black lives matter than their desire to dispense with the nuclear family. They are a marxist organization. If they get their way, all families (not just the nuclear ones) will suffer greatly.

Listen to the Audio Mises Wire version of this article. One of the most oft-cited and criticized goals of the Black Lives Matter organization is its stated desire to abolish the family as we know it. We disrupt the Western-prescribed nuclear family structure requirement by supporting each other as extended families and “villages” that collectively care for one another, especially our children, to the degree that mothers, parents, and children are comfortable. This idea isn’t unique to BLM, of course. “Disrupting” the “nuclear family” is a commonly stated goal among Maxist organizations.

An attack made less often is that Black Lives Matter wants to abolish the traditional family. For example, at the Republican National Convention, former NFL player Jack Brewer said the organization ""openly on their website calls for the destruction of the nuclear family. My fellow Americans, our families need each other. We need black fathers in the homes with their wives and children."" We found that while Black Lives Matter seeks change in how ""family"" is defined, especially with respect to public policy, it’s a leap to conclude that it wants to eliminate traditional family structures.
		

What specific statements or actions by Black Lives Matter explicitly indicate their intention to destroy the nuclear family?		
The Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation promotes LGBT ideology and opposes the nuclear family. The group’s platform aims to “dismantle cisgender privilege,” and “disrupt the Western-prescribed nuclear family structure.” “We foster a queer‐affirming network. When we gather, we do so with the intention of freeing ourselves from the tight grip of heteronormative thinking,” the group’s website says. At least one Black Lives Matter network affiliate has incorporated spiritual rituals into protests, drawing from animistic religions by calling forth deceased ancestors and pouring out libations for them.
		

What specific statements or actions by Black Lives Matter explicitly indicate their intention to destroy the nuclear family?		
My point in citing it is to demonstrate that the organization Black Lives Matter is acting according to an erroneous ideology that is clearly not in the best interests of black people. In a time when men need to step up and lovingly lead and protect their families, BLM wants to build a society “free from…environments in which men are centered.” Abusive men should be prosecuted, but homes where dads benevolently lead are a huge part of the solution, not the problem. (Additionally, nuclear families can be healthy environments for developing children’s sexual identities in the midst of our current gender confusion.)
		

What specific statements or actions by Black Lives Matter explicitly indicate their intention to destroy the nuclear family?		
Dismantling the family: Black Lives Matter endorses two contradictory policies: “We make our spaces family-friendly,” it states. It then looks forward to the destruction of the traditional family: We disrupt the Western-prescribed nuclear family structure requirement by supporting each other as extended families and “villages” that collectively care for one another, especially our children, to the degree that mothers, parents, and children are comfortable. Children raised in fatherless homes are more likely to drop out of school, abuse drugs or alcohol, be victims or perpetrators of physical and sexual abuse, live in poverty, commit other crimes, and go to prison than those raised in intact, two-parent households--the ""nuclear family structure"" BLM is warring against.

For one, a coronavirus infection presents in people differently. While some suffer from a mild infection, some have severe symptoms. So a simple home remedy can't act as the ""cure"" for all. Apart from that, drinking kadhas and concoctions such as these may only help lessen some of the mild symptoms and boost immunity, and not fight the virus in itself. WHO, months back also refuted claims of any one particular spice working to treat the virus. It also said while a lot of research is going on around the world, there is no one medicine or treatment which works for all.

In the meantime, remember that testimonials aren't a substitute for scientific evidence. Also, few diseases can be treated quickly, so beware of quick fixes. A miracle cure that claims to contain a secret ingredient is likely a hoax. If you have a question about a product, drug or method for treating or preventing infection with the COVID-19 virus, talk to your health care provider. To ask a question about a COVID-19 medication, you can call your local pharmacist or the FDA's Division of Drug Information.

In Brazil President Jair Bolsonaro went a step further and ordered the distribution of hydrochloroquine (O'Grady, 2018), prompting a run on “quina tea” (Langlois, 2020) while in Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko propounded the idea of a vodka cure (Bennetts, 2020). In Madagascar President Andry Rajoelina endorsed the benefits of Artemisia annua (sweet wormwood), a herbal remedy promoted as a treatment for COVID-19, which prompted orders from Equatorial Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Niger and Tanzania, (Finnan, 2020; Nordling, 2020; Hirsch, 2020), prompting denunciation by the World Health Organization Regional Office for Africa that that it lacked a scientific basis (Vaughan, 2020). In Ghana a popular Islamic cleric, numerologist and philosopher, Mallam Sham-una Uztar Jibril, proclaimed that he had identified a cure to COVID-19 in (unspecified) roots and leaves found only in Saudi Arabia and Afghanistan (“I Have Discovered the Cure to the Deadly Coronavirus – Popular Islamic Cleric, 2020).

Editor’s Note: This story, originally published in 2018, explores Ruth Bader Ginsberg’s views on abortion rights and Struck v. Secretary of Defense—the case that the late Supreme Court Justice argued that she wished legalized abortion, instead of Roe v. Wade. On June 24, 2022, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled 6-3 to overturn Roe v. Wade. When the U.S. Senate confirmed President Bill Clinton’s nomination of Ruth Bader Ginsburg to the U.S. Supreme Court by a 96-3 vote on Aug. 3, 1993 — precisely 25 years ago Friday — that decision set Ginsburg on the path to legal (and viral) history. That process was also noteworthy for her decision to take “the unprecedented step of strongly endorsing abortion rights” in a Supreme Court confirmation hearing, as TIME reported back then.

One of her most important, early cases on the Supreme Court was United States v Virginia, which struck down the men-only admission policy at Virginia Military Institute. Writing for the majority, Justice Ginsburg said that no law or policy should deny women ""full citizenship stature - equal opportunity to aspire, achieve, participate in and contribute to society based on their individual talents and capacities"". ""It really was the last step in her own trajectory as a lawyer in trying to get the Supreme Court to recognise that gender classifications are a violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment,"" says Paul Schiff Berman, professor of law at George Washington University and one of Ms Ginsburg's law clerks in the late 1990s. Over the decades, as the court has become more conservative, Justice Ginsburg has increasingly moved to the left, and is now famous for her fiery dissents.

What specific fitness activities and routines was Ruth Bader Ginsburg known to regularly practice, and how did they contribute to her public image regarding her fitness regime?		
In the days after the 8 November election, distressed liberals offered to donate their vital organs, shipments of fresh produce – anything – that might keep the supreme court justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg healthy and out of retirement. While Democrats fretted online about the bone density and blood pressure of the oldest and arguably best-known member of the supreme court, the justice, now 84, quietly continued her twice weekly workouts with her personal trainer, Bryant Johnson. “I always tell people, ‘If you think she’s tough on the bench, you should see her at the gym,’” said Johnson, whose new book The RBG Workout: How She Stays Strong … and You Can Too!, was released this month. Earlier this year, a Politico reporter asked Johnson if he could try Ginsburg’s routine. The decision, as always, was up to the justice.
		

What specific fitness activities and routines was Ruth Bader Ginsburg known to regularly practice, and how did they contribute to her public image regarding her fitness regime?		
Supreme Court spokeswoman Kathy Arberg said Ginsburg has her own exercise spot. “At Justice Ginsburg’s request, the Court has set aside the limited private space next to its health facility for Justice Ginsburg to exercise. Her doctors share her view that the training sessions are essential to her well-being,” Arberg told CNN. “The space is being used exclusively by the justice,” Arberg added. “No other justices are using the space, and the employee gym is closed to all users.”
		

What specific fitness activities and routines was Ruth Bader Ginsburg known to regularly practice, and how did they contribute to her public image regarding her fitness regime?		
Both find humor in the swirl of attention around her fitness and diet. “I am often consumed by the heavy lifting supreme court judging entails, reluctant to cease work until I am sure I’ve got it right,” Ginsburg writes in the book’s foreword. “But when time comes to meet with Bryant, I leave off and join him at the gym for justices. The hour-long routine he has developed suits me to a T.” They meet in the evenings, always with the TV tuned to NewsHour. The justice begins warming up slowly on the elliptical machine.

Former Vice President Joe Biden made false claims in a Sunday speech in which he urged Senate Republicans to let the winner of the presidential election fill the Supreme Court vacancy left by the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg on Friday. We’re still poring over the transcript of Biden’s address in Philadelphia, but here are two initial fact checks. Biden argued that it would be inappropriate for him to release a list of prospective Supreme Court nominees, as Trump did during the 2016 campaign and did again this month. Biden also claimed that the Trump campaign had not asked him to release such a list until after Ginsburg died.

This time, Trump used the list to highlight what he might do if he gets a chance in a second term, and to draw a distinction between him and Democratic nominee Joe Biden. Trump was the first presidential candidate to release such a list, and he said Biden should also do so. “Joe Biden has refused to release his list perhaps because he knows the names are so extremely far left that they could never withstand public scrutiny, or receive acceptance,” Trump said at the White House announcement. “He must release a list of justices for people to properly make a decision as to how they will vote.”
		

Before Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's passing, did the Trump campaign request President Biden to release his list of potential Supreme Court nominees?		
Trump had previously issued the same demand himself. In an August 24 speech at the Republican National Convention, Trump said, “I’m demanding, actually, a list: let Biden put up a list of the judges he’s going to appoint.” And in a June 22 interview with the Christian Broadcasting Network, Trump said, “You ought to ask a guy like a Biden or ask his campaign: give a list of judges, see where they stand on pro-life, see where they stand on it.” To bolster his case that the Senate should wait to confirm the next justice, Biden said: “By the way, there’s no court session between now and the end of this election.” Facts First: Biden’s claim is simply inaccurate. The court’s next session is scheduled to begin on October 5, nearly a month before Election Day on November 3.

In a June poll from the Pew Research Center, 66 percent of Biden supporters said Supreme Court appointments were “very important” to their 2020 vote, compared with 61 percent of Trump supporters. Demand Justice, a liberal advocacy group that focuses on judicial nominations, said it will use Trump’s announcement of the Supreme Court list in an ad campaign targeting the swing states of Arizona, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. “This gambit may have paid off for Trump in 2016, but the politics are different this time around,” Brian Fallon, the group’s executive director, said in a news release. “For every base conservative activist that is excited by this new Trump shortlist, there is likely to be a swing voter that will be turned off by the prospect of a Trump supermajority on the Supreme Court.”

Trump had released such a list in the 2016 election after the death of Justice Antonin Scalia and Senate Republicans’ refusal to start the confirmation process for President Barack Obama’s nominee. This election, there is no vacancy on the Supreme Court, where the conservative wing has a 5-4 advantage.

There’s a reason why no presidential candidate, other than Donald Trump, has ever done such a thing. First, putting a judge’s name on a list like that could influence that person’s decision making as a judge, and that would be wrong, or at least create the perception that it would have influence. Second, anyone put on a list like that under these circumstances will be subject to unrelenting political attacks.

Some suggest that by tying his campaign to protecting her legacy, Biden would also highlight his previous pledge to nominate the first black woman justice if he is elected. There are now calls for Biden to copy the playbook of then-candidate Donald Trump, who in May 2016 released a list of 11 people he would pick from to nominate to take the late Justice Antonin Scalia's seat. Hillary Clinton, the eventual Democratic nominee, did not release a list, since President Barack Obama had already nominated Merrick Garland, whose confirmation the Republican-controlled Senate blocked. Demand Justice, a progressive court reform group, already has a list of several women who they view as qualified, including NAACP Legal Defense Fund Director Sherrilyn Ifill and California Supreme Court Justice Leondra Kruger.

Ginsburg died of complications from metastatic pancreatic cancer, the court said. Her death just over six weeks before Election Day is likely to set off a heated battle over whether President Donald Trump should nominate, and the Republican-led Senate should confirm, her replacement, or if the seat should remain vacant until the outcome of his race against Democrat Joe Biden is known. Trump, who called Ginsburg “an amazing woman,” made his view clear on Saturday: He urged the Senate to consider “without delay” his upcoming pick for the high court. “We were put in this position of power and importance to make decisions for the people who so proudly elected us,” Trump tweeted, “the most important of which has long been considered to be the selection of United States Supreme Court Justices.

The Democratic Party may have signaled that it’s more open to proposals for changing the structure of the Supreme Court, but Biden previously told the New York Times that he’s against adding justices and term limits. Biden, per his website and in a statement to BuzzFeed News from his campaign, has broadly pledged to appoint diverse justices and judges committed to “civil rights and civil liberties” and who “respect” the abortion rights precedent of Roe v. Wade and the landmark school segregation decision Brown v. Board of Education. In June, Biden said his team was “putting together a list of a group of African American women who are qualified and have the experience to be on the court,” but he didn’t commit to making that list public. Democratic operatives and liberal legal advocates who spoke with BuzzFeed News didn’t agree about whether Biden should release his own list of names.

The list of exemptions has not yet been published, but the rules for face masks on public transport exempt anyone who cannot wear one ""because of any physical or mental illness or impairment, or disability"", who would experience ""severe distress"" from doing so, or relies on lip reading, among other reasons. Mr Hancock told the Commons: ""Sadly, sales assistants, cashiers and security guards have suffered disproportionately in this crisis. ""The death rate of sales and retail assistants is 75% higher amongst men and 60% higher amongst women than in the general population."" He added: ""There is also evidence that face coverings increase confidence in people to shop.""

We need to demand our Senators follow the “McConnell standard” invented in 2016. In February of an election year, the McConnell Republican-led Senate refused to even hold a single hearing for – and some Senators refused to even meet with – President Obama’s nominee to the Supreme Court. Call you Senators and tell them they should not vote on a new Justice to the Supreme Court this close to the election. My name is {name} and I am a registered voter your district, zip code {zip code). I am calling to urge you to follow the McConnell Rule and reject President Trump’s Supreme Court nominee. The election is less than 45 days away and, in fact, voting has already begun. This appointment is of lifetime consequence and, as Mitch McConnell said, “The American people should have a voice in the selection of their next Supreme Court Justice.”

Not sure what to write? I am simply writing the words my Senator used in 2016 to justify not holding a hearing for Merrick Garland. Here is a Google Document with a collection of useful GOP statements on not replacing a Supreme Court Justice during an election year. We have to fight right now but we also need to plan for the worst case scenario. If Trump and the Republicans rush a confirmation hearing, we must have a Democrat controlled Senate next term to take action. Democrats need to flip four seats to regain the majority.

Two Sigma is a hedge fund whose core business is “algorithmic trading”. In a nutshell, TS uses technology and mathematics to forecast stock prices, and build systems to automatically execute strategies to realize ludicrous profit. Two Sigma is like the math/CS equivalent of Pixar’s art/CS dream team. TS employs a small but high concentration of talent; there are literally International Math Olympiad medalists left and right, and the majority of people I ate lunch with were Phds. If you draw a directed graph between companies, where edges represent employee migration, you’ll see lots of edges going from Goldman, Microsoft, Google, and Facebook to Two Sigma. The hedge fund business is lucrative. I don’t have enough data, but I’m pretty sure full-time engineering/quant comp at firms like Two Sigma/Shaw/Citadel are slightly better (sometimes a lot better) than those of tech companies in the bay area.

303,There is a double standard in how Senate Republicans handled the confirmations for Obama's and Trump's high court picks.,"What were the specific differences, if any, in the Senate Republicans' approaches to the confirmation processes for the Supreme Court nominees of Presidents Obama and Trump?		
Within days of taking office, Republican President Donald Trump announced his first Supreme Court nominee: the conservative Judge Neil Gorsuch. The seat on the nine-member Supreme Court had opened about a year earlier, but Senate Republicans had blocked President Barack Obama's choice while making the unprecedented argument that no nominee should be considered during an election year. The American people would decide the next Supreme Court justice, the GOP argued, via the 2016 presidential election. The gamble, led by Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, paid off, but getting Trump's pick onto the nation's highest court would require a similarly historic and aggressive tactic: a ""nuclear option"" change to Senate rules.
		

What were the specific differences, if any, in the Senate Republicans' approaches to the confirmation processes for the Supreme Court nominees of Presidents Obama and Trump?		
Democrats still harbor resentment for that move, and brought it up many times during the confirmation hearing Justice Neil Gorsuch, Trump’s first high court pick. Kavanaugh is quoted as saying Garland “is supremely qualified by the objective characteristics of experience, temperament, writing ability, scholarly ability for the Supreme Court.” But he added: “Obviously questions about the process of what’s going on and the direction of the Supreme Court and what role judicial philosophy should play in the confirmation process are really above my pay grade.” Watch: Trump Nominates Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court
		

What were the specific differences, if any, in the Senate Republicans' approaches to the confirmation processes for the Supreme Court nominees of Presidents Obama and Trump?		
That left them powerless to stop McConnell from eliminating the filibuster for Supreme Court nominees in 2017, paving the way to confirmation of Trump's first choice and probably his second. And that is the predicament in which they find themselves today. A previous version of this story incorrectly said that before 2016, the last time a Democratic president made a Supreme Court appointment while Republicans held the Senate was in 1885.
		

What were the specific differences, if any, in the Senate Republicans' approaches to the confirmation processes for the Supreme Court nominees of Presidents Obama and Trump?		
Under McConnell, the Senate changed the confirmation rules to allow for a simple majority. The next pick could shape important decisions beyond abortion rights, including any legal challenges that may stem from the 2020 election. In the interim, if the court were to take cases with eight justices, 4-4 ties would revert the decision to a lower court; for instance, the Affordable Care Act could then be struck down by a lower Texas court. The 2018 hearings on Trump’s second pick, now-Justice Brett Kavanaugh, turned into a bitter partisan battle after sexual assault allegations were made.
		

What were the specific differences, if any, in the Senate Republicans' approaches to the confirmation processes for the Supreme Court nominees of Presidents Obama and Trump?		
""Of course,"" said McConnell, ""the American people should have a say in the court's direction. It is a president's constitutional right to nominate a Supreme Court justice, and it is the Senate's constitutional right to act as a check on the president and withhold its consent."" Supreme Court picks have often been controversial. There have been contentious hearings and floor debates and contested votes. But to ignore the nominee entirely, as if no vacancy existed? There was no precedent for such an action since the period around the Civil War and Reconstruction. No Democratic president had made an appointment while Republicans held the Senate since 1895.
		

What were the specific differences, if any, in the Senate Republicans' approaches to the confirmation processes for the Supreme Court nominees of Presidents Obama and Trump?		
Trump to Senate: Vote ‘without delay’ on his high court pick The White House was making preparations to select a nominee for the seat held by Ginsburg, who spent her final years on the bench as the leader of the court’s liberal wing. President Donald Trump on Saturday urged the Republican-run Senate to consider “without delay” his upcoming nomination to fill the Supreme Court seat vacated by the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg just six weeks before the election. The White House was making preparations to select a nominee for the seat held by Ginsburg, who spent her final years on the bench as the unquestioned leader of the court’s liberal wing.
		

What were the specific differences, if any, in the Senate Republicans' approaches to the confirmation processes for the Supreme Court nominees of Presidents Obama and Trump?		
In February 2016, days after the conservative Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia died, Republicans made an unprecedented declaration: The Senate would not hear or confirm any nominee to fill the unexpected vacancy until the country had elected a new president in November. Don't even try nominating anyone, McConnell told Obama, the Constitution requires ""the advice and consent of the Senate."" ""We intend to exercise the constitutional power granted the Senate under Article II, Section 2 to ensure the American people are not deprived of the opportunity to engage in a full and robust debate over the type of jurist they wish to decide some of the most critical issues of our time,"" Republican members of the Senate Judiciary Committee wrote in a letter, claiming the move was ""born of a necessity to protect the will of the American people."" Obama nominated Judge Merrick Garland anyway. His nomination lingered for eight months — Garland passed the time with puzzles and volunteering, it was later reported — before Republican Donald Trump won the presidency and dashed any leftover hopes that Garland might one day take a seat on the nation's highest court.
		

What were the specific differences, if any, in the Senate Republicans' approaches to the confirmation processes for the Supreme Court nominees of Presidents Obama and Trump?		
Instead of fanning the flames of partisanship, Trump should honor the Constitution and its requirement that the Senate advise and consent to nominees. The Trump administration must engage senators early in the vetting and screening process and must work with them to find qualified, fair, and independent judges.

What were the specific differences, if any, in the Senate Republicans' approaches to the confirmation processes for the Supreme Court nominees of Presidents Obama and Trump?		
Senate Democrats will get a lot of advice about how to handle President Donald Trump’s nominee to the Supreme Court — and it appears they need it. There’s pressure from liberal advocacy groups and the party’s energized base for Democrats to pull out all the stops in an attempt to block Judge Neil Gorsuch’s Supreme Court confirmation. Not only do those interests have concerns about his approach to abortion rights and environmental law, but they thirst for revenge for Republicans’ obstruction of former President Barack Obama’s nominee for the same seat. Some moderate legal and political commentators, meanwhile, have urged Democrats to wait for another potential Supreme Court nominee to launch an all-out confirmation war — a possibility during the Trump administration since two justices are in their 80s.
		

What were the specific differences, if any, in the Senate Republicans' approaches to the confirmation processes for the Supreme Court nominees of Presidents Obama and Trump?		
Donald Trump once suggested that he might appoint his sister, a federal appeals court judge, to the Supreme Court, though he later said he was joking. Just to be clear, he went even further at a debate, naming two federal judges appointed by George W. Bush as potential high court nominees. Now that President Obama has nominated Merrick Garland, Trump is going even further, essentially offering a deal to conservatives nervous about his potential influence on the Supreme Court. Speaking at the construction site for his new hotel in Washington, D.C., Monday, Trump said he will make a list public in the next week of 10 conservative judges that he would consider nominating to the Supreme Court.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is a global outbreak of coronavirus – an infectious disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Cases of novel coronavirus (nCoV) were first detected in China in December 2019, with the virus spreading rapidly to other countries across the world. This led WHO to declare a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) on 30 January 2020 and to characterize the outbreak as a pandemic on 11 March 2020. On 5 May 2023, more than three years into the pandemic, the WHO Emergency Committee on COVID-19 recommended to the Director-General, who accepted the recommendation, that given the disease was by now well established and ongoing, it no longer fit the definition of a PHEIC.

After some trouble breaching the atmosphere, the parachutes on Soyuz 1 were deployed but did not unfold correctly, making the spacecraft impossible to slow down. Soyuz 1 crashed into Earth on April 24, 1967, killing cosmonaut Vladimir Komarov. Komarov was the first fatality in spaceflight and, since his death, has been honored with memorials and monuments near the site of the crash and in Russia for his bravery and skill. Space explorers need to stay in good physical health during their time in outer space. Because of this necessity, space stations have exercise equipment that astronauts or cosmonauts can use to stay fit. During a mission to the Mir space station in 1995, astronaut Norman Thagard was attempting to do just that with a piece of exercise equipment for performing deep knee bends.

1967: Russian cosmonaut dies in space crashThe Soviet Union has announced the catastrophic failure of its latest space mission, with the crash of Soyuz 1 and the death of the cosmonaut on board. Colonel Vladimir Komarov, 40, is the first known victim of a space flight. He was an experienced cosmonaut, on his second flight, and had completed all his experiments successfully before returning to Earth. But within seconds of landing, just after he re-entered the Earth's atmosphere, the strings of the parachute intended to slow his descent apparently became tangled. The spaceship hurtled to the ground from four miles up. It is likely that Colonel Komarov was killed instantly on impact.

On April 24, 1967, Soviet cosmonaut Vladimir Komarov is killed when his parachute fails to deploy during his spacecraft’s landing. Komarov was testing the spacecraft Soyuz I in the midst of the space race between the United States and the Soviet Union. Earlier in 1967, the U.S. space program had experienced its own tragedy. Gus Grissom, Edward White and Roger Chafee, NASA astronauts in the Apollo program, were killed in a fire during tests on the ground. Komarov, a fighter pilot and aeronautical engineer, had made his first space trip in 1964, three years before the doomed 1967 voyage.

He's known as the first person to die during spaceflight. Forty-five years ago, cosmonaut Vladimir Komarov died when the parachutes on his Soyuz 1 space capsule failed to deploy properly after reentry into the Earth's atmosphere. The capsule slammed onto Soviet soil near Orenburg, Russia, on April 24, 1967. Interest in Komarov's tragic story was rekindled last year with the publication of ""Starman: The Truth Behind the Legend of Yuri Gagarin,"" a biography of the Soviet cosmonaut who became the first human in space in April 1961.

As with the three American astronauts, the history of the pilot of Soyuz 1 is that of a pioneer who died in the quest for new horizons. But as often happens in these cases, the facts have been adorned with legends that attempt to further magnify the tragic heroism of the event. These are the facts. On April 23, 1967, Komarov took off into Earth orbit aboard the first manned Soyuz spacecraft.

Update: United States Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg died at her Washington D.C. home on Friday, Sept. 18. In announcing her passing, the Supreme Court said her death was caused by complications from metastatic cancer of the pancreas. Ginsburg was 87. This blog has been updated to reflect new developments. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s battles with cancer were well documented.

How long and what types of cancer did Ruth Bader Ginsburg fight before her passing in September 2020?		
The name Ruth Bader Ginsburg became almost synonymous with strength and stamina as she rose to prominence in judicial and feminist circles throughout her long career. Famously nicknamed the Notorious RBG and known for her grueling fitness regimen, the late Supreme Court justice also struggled with cancer and other health issues for the better part of her time on the bench — culminating with her death on Sept. 18 at the age of 87 of complications from metastatic pancreatic cancer. Ginsburg’s health issues became public in 1999, six years after her appointment to the Supreme Court, when she had surgery for early-stage colon cancer. Ten years later, she went through the same process for pancreatic cancer. And nearly a decade after that, the Supreme Court announced that Ginsburg had undergone surgery to have two cancerous growths removed from her left lung.

It helps that Two Sigma is not new to private markets. As Thorn explains it, Sightway the brand may have only existed for two years — but Two Sigma began developing its private-equity business as far back as 2008. Thorn himself joined the quantitative investment firm in 2012, when he was brought in to build out a team and portfolio of privately held companies. The launch of Sightway in 2018 coincided with the decision to tap outside institutional investors for the additional capital needed to “grow our companies in greater size and scale,” Thorn explains. Raising a fund to support an existing portfolio of companies put Sightway in a unique position. On the one hand, they had what one investor describes as “proof of concept” and “several years of success” investing inside money.

READ: Colorado unveils plan for how doctors will decide who receives life-saving coronavirus treatment — and who doesn’t Dr. Jonathan Samet, the dean of the Colorado School of Public Health, which is helping produce the model, said researchers were recently able to refine their projections by adding data about Colorado’s age distribution. And they are also receiving patient-level information from the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment to better understand how COVID-19 has spread across Colorado. “This has been a very rapid two weeks of modeling efforts,” he said.
		

Is there verifiable evidence or documented records showing that John Cammo specifically predicted President Trump's Covid-19 infection before it occurred?		
- TESTING: Here’s where to find a community testing site. The state is now encouraging anyone with symptoms to get tested. That makes the current models vary quite a bit and, in turn, means policymakers have to essentially pick their model when deciding how to respond to the spread of COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus. You see this playing out now in disputes between the federal and state governments — where states are preparing hospitals for massive patient surges that the feds say won’t arrive. “I mean, it could be you have shortages, and it could also be that you have some that have way overestimated the number of ventilators they need,” President Donald Trump said last weekend.

That means, if the state even just relaxes its social distancing rules, cases will likely climb back up. “In a nutshell, we anticipate a secondary spike around June” if the state eases social distancing rules later this spring, Colborn wrote in an email. Perhaps the most widely cited coronavirus model out there is one produced by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington. This is the model Trump and federal officials most often cite in their press briefings. And it’s the one that caused Dr. Deborah Birx, the coordinator of the White House coronavirus task force, to include Colorado in a list of emerging hotspots.

“We built covidactnow.org to solve an urgent problem: If we try to fight COVID in the present we will lose,” the team wrote on its website. “We can only beat COVID by understanding what it will do in the future. Our leaders need a forecasting tool to better understand the future spread of COVID.” It makes sense, then, that this model presents the bleakest picture for Colorado. Part of its purpose is to hammer home how serious this virus is. If Colorado had taken no action, the model projects that the state would have seen 61,000 deaths from COVID-19, nearly twice the number the CU model projected.

Even with social distancing measures in place, if compliance with those measures is poor, the model expects Colorado to exceed hospital capacity by early May and then surge up to nearly 32,000 hospitalizations by mid-June. Asked about this model, CU’s Colborn said it’s a legitimate model built by a strong team of scientists. So, while the Covid Act Now model hopefully doesn’t show what will happen in the state, she said it’s still worth considering.

Asked whether that was feasible, Trump said it's not only possible but necessary to soon lift the current social-isolation measures that have sent the economy into a spiral. “Again, this cure is worse than the problem,'' Trump said. ""Many people, in my opinion more people, are going to die if we allow this to continue.

Which I guess gives some credence to the article itself. For me, and many non-Americans, all the rhetoric can be dismissed. It all comes down to one thing: Donald Trump. If Trump is re-elected, then the rest of the world will know that the American system may be beyond repair. There is no need to go into all the details of whether or not Trump is good for the US economy, or race relations, or immigration or anything else.

313,"English Playwright William Shakespeare’s plays are the work of Amelia Bassano, a black woman who died unpublished and in poverty.","Is there credible historical evidence or scholarly consensus supporting the theory that Amelia Bassano wrote the plays attributed to William Shakespeare?		
In step with the professional customs of his time, the bard collaborated with other playwrights throughout his career. I don’t believe that Emilia Bassano wrote the plays of Shakespeare. I don’t think Elizabeth Winkler does either. Emilia Bassano is, however, a very interesting, too-little-considered person, robustly present in the cultural world of Shakespeare’s England and intimately tied to the court. So for that reminder alone, Winkler’s recent essay, “Was Shakespeare a Woman?” is of value.
		

Is there credible historical evidence or scholarly consensus supporting the theory that Amelia Bassano wrote the plays attributed to William Shakespeare?		
Could Bassano have known Shakespeare? Certainly. Indeed, she has been proposed as the “dark lady” of Shakespeare sonnets, but that remains unproved, though not impossible. “Not impossible,” however, is a low bar. Could she have written the plays of Shakespeare? Winkler is curious, and she points to knowledge and experiences that Bassano had but that could seem unlikely for Shakespeare, and flirts with the idea that Shakespeare functioned as Bassano’s beard. That seems to me to be awfully close to impossible. But could Bassano have collaborated in some way with Shakespeare? To paraphrase the title of one of the many responses Winkler’s article elicited, Shakespeare wasn’t a Jewish woman and he was a genius.
		

Is there credible historical evidence or scholarly consensus supporting the theory that Amelia Bassano wrote the plays attributed to William Shakespeare?		
No such supporting evidence exists for any other candidate, and Shakespeare’s authorship was not questioned during his lifetime or for centuries after his death. Surely there can be no stronger proof of Shakespeare’s role of playwright than records of the acknowledgment of that by his friends and colleagues. Scores of actors and writers referred to him, identifying him as a writer. After his death there were several eulogies that spoke of his work by poets like Hugh Holland, Leonard Digges, and most convincing, Shakespeare’s friend and workmate, Ben Jonson: To the Memory of My Beloved the Author, Mr William Shakespeare and What He Hath Left Us, published in the First Folio in 1623. No mention is made here of the two females who may well have written some, many or all of Shakespeare’s plays – namely Mary Sidney Herbert(Countess of Pembroke) and Emilia Bassano who was of Italian-Jewish descent.
		

Is there credible historical evidence or scholarly consensus supporting the theory that Amelia Bassano wrote the plays attributed to William Shakespeare?		
Oxfordians—as those who believe in de Vere’s authorship of the Bard’s works are known—argue that he concealed his identity because his works were so politically provocative, and he wished to avoid being outed as a lowly playwright. But until hard evidence surfaces linking his plays to someone else, the man with the strongest claim to the plays of William Shakespeare appears to be…William Shakespeare. For one thing, Oxford died in 1604, and some of Shakespeare’s greatest plays (including “King Lear,” “The Tempest” and “Macbeth”) were published after that date. Shakespeare’s supporters—known as Stratfordians—emphasize the fact that the body of evidence that does exist points to Shakespeare, and no one else, as the author of his works.
		

Is there credible historical evidence or scholarly consensus supporting the theory that Amelia Bassano wrote the plays attributed to William Shakespeare?		
Mary was an accomplished writer, completing a highly praised translation of religious works, and several “closet dramas” (plays written for private or small-group performances), a format frequently used by women of the era who were unable to openly participate in the professional theater. Mary was also a noted arts patron, running a prominent literary salon that counted poets Edmund Spenser and Jonson among its members and providing funds to a theater company that was one of the first to produce Shakespeare’s plays. More recently, Emilia Bassano has been the focus of renewed research. The London-born daughter of Venetian merchants, Bassano was one of the first English women to publish a volume of poetry. Historians believe Bassano’s family were likely converted Jews, and the inclusion of Jewish characters and themes, treated in a more positive way than by many other authors of the day, could be explained by Bassano’s authorship.
		

Is there credible historical evidence or scholarly consensus supporting the theory that Amelia Bassano wrote the plays attributed to William Shakespeare?		
Most scholars accept that William Shakespeare was born in Stratford-upon-Avon, and spent time acting in London before returning to Stratford, where he lived until his death in 1616. But actual documentation of his life is pitifully scarce: little more than several signatures, records of his marriage to Anne Hathaway and the birth of their children, a three-page will and some business papers unrelated to writing. Above all, nothing has been found documenting the composition of the more than 36 plays and 154 sonnets attributed to him, collectively considered the greatest body of work in the history of the English language. In the absence of such “proof” of authorship, some skeptics have posed the question: How could a man of such humble origins and education come by such wealth of insight, wide-ranging understanding of complex legal and political matters and intimate knowledge of life in the English court?
		

Is there credible historical evidence or scholarly consensus supporting the theory that Amelia Bassano wrote the plays attributed to William Shakespeare?		
historical record tells us so, strongly and unequivocally. The historical evidence demonstrates that one and the same man, William Shakespeare of Stratford-upon-Avon, was William Shakespeare the player, William Shakespeare the Globe-sharer, and William Shakespeare the author of the plays and poems that bear his name -- and no person of the Elizabethan and Jacobean eras ever doubted the attribution. No Elizabethan ever suggested that Shakespeare's plays and poems were written by someone else, or that Shakespeare the player was not Shakespeare the author, or that Shakespeare the Globe-sharer was not Shakespeare of Stratford. No contemporary of Shakespeare's ever suggested that the name used by the player, the Globe-sharer, or the author was a pseudonym; and none of the major alternative candidates -- not Francis Bacon, not the Earl of Oxford, not Christopher Marlowe -- had any connection with Shakespeare's acting company or with his friends and fellow actors. Good evidence that William Shakespeare wrote the plays and poems bearing his name is the fact that his name appears on them as the author.

Is there any solid evidence that Shakespeare's works were written by others? I have heard this, specifically that Sir Francis Bacon was one of many authors. Is there any proof to this?
		

Is there credible historical evidence or scholarly consensus supporting the theory that Amelia Bassano wrote the plays attributed to William Shakespeare?		
It's true that no one single document states categorically that William Shakespeare of Stratford-upon-Avon wrote Hamlet and King Lear, but then no such document exists for any other playwright of the time either. The evidence is cumulative and interconnected, and taken as a whole it leaves no doubt that a single man was actor, author, and Stratford property owner. In this essay we summarize this evidence in order to illustrate the speciousness of antistratfordian claims that there is some ""mystery"" about the authorship of Shakespeare's works. Good evidence that William Shakespeare wrote the plays and poems bearing his name is the fact that his name appears on them as the author.
		

Is there credible historical evidence or scholarly consensus supporting the theory that Amelia Bassano wrote the plays attributed to William Shakespeare?		
Since the 19th century, skeptics have questioned the authorship of William Shakespeare’s works, asserting that the lower-middle-class son of a glove-maker couldn’t possibly be the poet and playwright celebrated as the best writer in the English language. These “Antistratfordians” argue that “Shakespeare” was a pen name adopted to protect the true author from the plays’ bold, controversial politics. But Shakespeare scholar and UAB English professor Rebecca Bach, Ph.D., says that in the academic world, there is no credible opposition to the idea that Shakespeare wrote Shakespeare. “The main proponents in the late 20th century are people who believe they can trace their ancestry to the candidates they promote,” she says.

Antonin Scalia is sworn in as associate justice of the Supreme Court by Chief Justice Warren Burger, right, at the White House in 1986. Scalia was confirmed by a vote of 98-0.(File photo by Getty Images) Scalia’s unanimous confirmation wasn’t a complete outlier. John Paul Stevens was confirmed 98-0 in 1975, and Sandra Day O’Connor joined the bench on a 99-0 vote in 1981.

The average number of years that Justices have served is 16. The longest serving Chief Justice was Chief Justice John Marshall who served for 34 years, 5 months and 11 days from 1801 to 1835. The shortest serving Chief Justice was John Rutledge who was appointed under a temporary commission because the Senate was in recess. He served for 5 months and 14 days before the Senate reconvened and rejected his nomination.

The longest serving Justice was William O. Douglas who served for 36 years, 7 months, and 8 days from 1939 to 1975. John Rutledge served the shortest tenure as an Associate Justice at one year and 18 days, from 1790 to 1791. The next shortest tenure was that of James F. Byrnes who served 1 year, 2 months, and 25 days from 1941 to 1942. For many years, Justice Thomas Johnson was thought to have been the shortest serving Justice but under a temporary recess appointment he served a total of 1 year, 3 months and 28 days.

The number of Justices on the Supreme Court changed six times before settling at the present total of nine in 1869. Since the formation of the Court in 1790, there have been only 17 Chief Justices* and 104 Associate Justices, with Justices serving for an average of 16 years. Despite this important institutional continuity, the Court has had periodic infusions of new Justices and new ideas throughout its existence; on average a new Justice joins the Court almost every two years.

Over the past 170 years alone, average life expectancy in the United States has increased from an average of about 38 years to nearly 80 years.84 As a result, Supreme Court justices are serving significantly longer terms than their early predecessors. U.S. Supreme Court justices who served between 1789 and 1828, on average, held their posts for less than 10 years, vacating the bench before the age of 60.85 Meanwhile, justices appointed after 1980 who have since left, on average, served for more than 25 years and remained on the Supreme Court until they were close to 80 years old.86 If these trends persist, nearly half of the justices currently serving on the Supreme Court will remain on the bench until at least 2035.87 A July 2018 Morning Consult/Politico poll found that 61 percent of Americans approve of term limits for Supreme Court justices, including 67 percent of Democrats and 58 percent of Republicans.88 Even some current Supreme Court justices, such as Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Stephen Breyer, have expressed support for term limits.89 In a 1983 White House memo, Roberts wrote, “Setting a term of, say, 15 years would ensure that federal judges would not lose all touch with reality through decades of ivory tower existence.”90 Congress does not necessarily need to pass a constitutional amendment to establish term limits for federal judges.

Indeed, Wilson made two Supreme Court appointments in 1916. What about other evidence? Senate leaders and some pundits point to three historical events arguably supporting their claim that the Senate shuts down the Supreme Court confirmation process in presidential election years. First, Senator Chuck Grassley, the chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, has noted that the last time a Supreme Court nomination was both made and confirmed in a presidential election year was 1932. This is true, but it hardly constitutes a tradition. Indeed, the Senate confirmed Frank Murphy in January 1940 and Anthony Kennedy in 1988, while it confirmed William Brennan in 1957, after Eisenhower had named him as a recess appointment and nominee to the Court in 1956.

Even highly-contentious nomination battles in the past … followed the normal process of hearings and an up-or-down vote.”70 A March 2016 poll found that two-thirds of Americans, including 55 percent of Republicans and 67 percent of Democrats, wanted the Senate to hold a hearing for Garland’s nomination, with most Americans saying that he should be confirmed to the Supreme Court.71 The effort to steal this Supreme Court seat had real implications for the American people. Because of the Senate’s refusal to fill Scalia’s vacancy, the Supreme Court operated with only eight justices for over a year. During that time, it deadlocked on important cases, including one that would have prevented the inhumane deportation of immigrant families.72 Ultimately, however, conservative efforts to pack the courts paid off for them.

It came as no surprise to many people when the federal government announced on Friday that the Canada-U.S. land border — which closed on March 21 to non-essential traffic — would remain shut until at least Sept. 21. Canadians can still fly to the U.S., but that rule isn't reciprocal: Canada prohibits U.S. visitors from entering via all modes of transport. Canada and the U.S. review their border closure agreement every 30 days. Several experts in different fields have told CBC News that they predict the border won't reopen until sometime next year.

Turkey is a party to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the European Convention on Human Rights, both of which prohibit arbitrary arrest and detention and inhuman and degrading treatment. If Turkey detains a person to deport them but there is no realistic prospect of doing so, including because they would face harm in their country, or the person is unable to challenge their removal, the detention is arbitrary.

FACT CHECK: Despite his suggestion, Biden would not be the first president without an Ivy League degree, as several presidents in the country's history did not receive a college degree at all. Biden would be the first president since Ronald Reagan to be elected president without an Ivy League education. The Biden-Harris ticket is the first since the 1984 ticket of Walter Mondale and Geraldine Ferraro to have two non-Ivy League graduates and if successful, the first winning ticket since 1976 with Jimmy Carter and Mondale.

In 1988, Michael Dukakis was a Harvard Law School grad, and in 1984, Geraldine Ferraro—another female vice presidential nominee—had graduated from Fordham University, one of the 63 so-called ""hidden Ivies"" across the United States. The last ticket without an Ivy League graduate to win the presidency was Jimmy Carter and Walter Mondale in 1976. The most recent Republican ticket without an Ivy League graduate was John McCain and Sarah Palin in 2008. The main reason the distinction matters is that the long history of Ivy League graduates among presidential candidates hails from an era when an Ivy League education was hailed as a mark of being an intellectual and cultural elite.

For all his longevity in Washington, Biden has never quite belonged to the technocratic élite.

Biden is the first Democratic nominee without an Ivy League degree since Walter Mondale, in 1984. In a milieu of Rhodes Scholars and former professors, he is thin-skinned about condescension, real and imagined. When Obama chose him as his running mate, he said, “I want your point of view, Joe. I just want it in ten-minute increments, not sixty-minute increments.” Biden chafed, telling David Axelrod, Obama’s chief strategist, “I still think I’d be the best President.”

But the two have another historical distinction: Their pairing marks the first time since 1984 that the Democratic ticket hasn't had an Ivy League graduate. Biden double majored in history and political science and received his Bachelor of Arts (BA) from the University of Delaware in Newark in 1965. He received his Doctor of Jurisprudence (JD) from Syracuse University in New York state in 1968.
		

Has any U.S. president been elected who did not have an Ivy League degree prior to Joe Biden?		
In fact, the U.S. has had Ivy League-educated presidential candidates since the 18th century. During the most recent Democratic presidential primaries, 11 out of the 14 candidates born after 1960 were educated at Ivy League universities, while only two attended state institutions, according to Daniel K. Williams, a professor of history at the University of West Georgia. Williams and others think there may be a disconnect between the Democratic Ivy League connection and contemporary voters. In a 2019 article, he noted, ""Among the 20 million American undergraduates who begin college each year, only 0.4 percent go to the Ivy League, while nearly 75 percent go to public colleges and universities.""

The Ivy League School That Won't Talk About Its Most Famous Graduate The University of Pennsylvania wanted a president. Trump was the one it got. For 176 years, William Henry Harrison was the only president the University of Pennsylvania had any kind of claim on, and even then it was kind of a stretch. As a student, Harrison did a brief stint at Penn, but he didn’t stay long enough to get a degree. And he only lasted a month in office, dying of pneumonia in April of 1841.

12-20,2018 / Industry news / Chat online / Leave a message Cassava is the most important root crop in Nigeria. In Nigeria, only cassava accounts for about 45% of Nigeria's agricultural GDP, mainly for food or household use, but its industrial processing and utilization of cassava production and processing in nigeria is very limited. According to FAO statistics, the current annual output of cassava in the world is 250 million tons, and the output value is 100 billion US dollars, more than half of it is produced in Africa. Nigeria is the world's largest cassava producer with an annual output of 45 million tons and an output value of 18 billion US dollars, accounting for one third of the total production in Africa.

Most of the populations in Africa, Latin America and Asia depend on cassava for their livelihoods because cassava provides food and business opportunities for farmers and traders. In some parts of Africa, cassava accounts for more than 50% of people's daily diet. Among all African countries, cassava production and processing in nigeria ranks first, accounting for about one-fifth of the world's cassava production. Cassava is easy to grow in arid areas with very limited rainfall, and Nigerian farmers choose cassava for their stubborn viability in drought. It is estimated that by 2020, cassava production and processing in nigeria will double, but currently 90% of cassava is consumed in Nigeria.

- Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories. The White House scrapped a plan by the US Postal Service to send every American household a face mask in April, The Washington Post reported on Thursday, citing documents obtained through public-records requests. The Post obtained thousands of internal Postal Service documents that revealed previously unreported details of the agency's struggle to deal with the Trump administration's response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The documents showed that in early April, after public-health experts began recommending face masks to mitigate the spread of COVID-19, some officials at the Department of Health and Human Services suggested that the Postal Service, an agency that delivers mail to the entire country, could be uniquely positioned to deliver packs of reusable masks to every American household.

The Washington Post was the first to report that the Trump administration had once had a plan to send masks directly to U.S. households. The internal HHS email from June obtained by NBC News was sent in response to an inquiry from a nongovernmental entity asking why the Trump administration did not move forward with the plan. In the email, a senior HHS official says that the ""White House"" made the decision not to move forward and that, instead, the masks would be manufactured and distributed to businesses, state and federal agencies and nonprofit organizations. Asked why the White House scrapped household distribution, an HHS spokesperson did not respond to the question, saying instead: ""Cloth face masks are now widely available from a number of vendors and easily accessible to the American public.

WASHINGTON — The White House scrapped an effort to send hundreds of millions of cloth masks to every U.S. household in April, choosing instead to distribute the masks to nonprofit organizations and state and federal agencies, according to an internal email from a senior Trump administration official obtained by NBC News. A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services told NBC News that 600 million masks have been distributed around the country to nonprofits and state and federal agencies through the means the Trump administration ultimately chose. The mask distribution program was called Project America Strong. Public health experts said sending masks directly to Americans' homes in the early days of the global pandemic would have sent a stronger message encouraging Americans to wear masks.

The program is no longer accepting new requests for face masks, according to its website, and instead encourages applicants to purchase face masks elsewhere or make their own. President Donald Trump said on Aug. 12 that the government would also send 120 million face masks to schools ahead of the fall. ""The Postal Service connects every single person in American, and the president could have used it for public health, but he didn't,"" Austin Evers, the executive director of American Oversight, told ABC News, calling out Trump.

Despite the economic crisis due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, Trump in May promised to continue fighting the ACA, stating “We want to terminate health care under Obamacare.” The case is expected to go before the Supreme Court in the spring of 2021.

""President Trump and the Republicans’ campaign to rip away the protections and benefits of the Affordable Care Act in the middle of the coronavirus crisis is an act of unfathomable cruelty,"" she stated. In 2017, Trump eliminated the individual mandate—the heart of the ACA that requires everyone to have health coverage and lays the groundwork for a risk pool that is more balanced between the sick and the healthy and the young and the old.

The Trump administration yesterday asked the Supreme Court to repeal the Affordable Care Act (ACA, also known as Obamacare) stating ""the entire ACA act must fall,"" hours after Republican state attorneys general, the coalition challenging the law, filed its briefs in the case.

“Without the ACA, we would have upward of 20 million more people uninsured, and there would be no safety net as people are battling these [issues], as people are losing their jobs and their health insurance.” In a commentary published by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, authors noted that the repeal of ACA was expected to cause 20 million individuals to lose coverage, but with the added COVID-19 crisis, that number will likely increase, especially if the United States enters a recession. “Forecasts predict that economic hardship will continue through next spring, when the Supreme Court will render its decision. At that time, with unemployment projected to be about 10% and more people relying on Medicaid expansion and the marketplace’s premium assistance, many more people could lose coverage than projected pre-crisis,” authors wrote.

Without the unlawful mandate, the rest of the law cannot stand,” Paxton said in a statement. “Obamacare has failed, and the sooner it is invalidated, the sooner each state can decide what type of health care system will best provide for those with preexisting conditions, which is the way the Founders intended.”

When it comes to COVID-19, researchers argue that repealing the ACA would not only limit coverage but cut also funding for the CDC and public health efforts, end the requirement that all insurers cover services like vaccines without cost sharing, and allow insurers to rescind coverage if someone develops health problems associated with an undisclosed preexisting condition. “The Administration and state attorneys generals’ effort to repeal the ACA through the courts has always threatened health and financial hardship for millions,” the authors concluded. ""Doubling down on it in a time of crisis only adds to what would be devastating results.”

Carlos A. Gimenez is the Mayor of Miami-Dade – Florida’s most populous county. He is Miami-Dade’s highest-ranking elected official and chief administrator, who oversees a metropolitan government with 28,000 employees, an annual budget of approximately $7.4 billion, and serving 2.7 million residents. Since assuming office in 2011 after a special election, Mayor Gimenez has continued to consistently hold the line on tax increases and to date, the average homeowner has saved approximately $1,400 in property taxes. He championed and secured approval for the largest tax cut in County history six years ago, and collectively Miami-Dade taxpayers have saved approximately $2 billion during his tenure. Gimenez was re-elected as Mayor in 2012 and again in 2016 for two consecutive four-year terms. He brings with him over 40 years of public service experience.

Forgive Ladra and her friends if we have lost all faith in Miami-Dade Mayor Carlos “Cry Wolf” Gimenez and the county bean counters. First, there was a $208 million shortfall in the Miami-Dade budget. Then it was $200 million. Then, if I recall correctly, it fell to $160 million. This is beginning to feel like a recurring nightmare. In his desperate attempt to find a taxpayer bailout for the team he apparently overpaid for, Stephen Ross — one of the richest men in the U.S, according to Forbes — is going on his third try for subsidies from Miami-Dade County. It looks like Miami-Dade Carlos Gimenez is trying to get some feedback on the directions and priorities he announced last week at the State of the County address.

• Taxpayer-funded car deals for elected officials are common. The perk was available to all the Miami-Dade county commissioners. Even Gimenez's opponent Robaina was given cars by the city to drive while he was mayor of Hialeah. While the cars driven by Robaina, a Chevy Tahoe and a Chevy Suburban aren't ""fancy European"" cars, they are nice cars. • Alvarez and Gimenez did not have identical car deals. Alvarez went shopping for a BMW on the county dime even though he already had access to two Chevys and two police officers to drive him. When Gimenez left the county he said he took over the lease -- unlike Alvarez who left the county on the hook.

Gimenez was a county commissioner between 2004 and 2011 when he stepped down to run for mayor. In his final year he was earning an annual salary of $6,000 plus about $55,000 in benefits, including the car allowance. J.C. Planas, an attorney for the Gimenez campaign and a former state legislator, told us in an e-mail that Gimenez was entitled to the same car allowances as all the commissioners. For the last year and a half, Gimenez drove a Mercedes-Benz ML and prior to that a Mercedes-Benz E320. Gimenez said in a June 16 interview that his most recent car, the Mercedes-Benz ML, was silver, and he thought it was a 2009 car.

On May 30, U.S. Vice President Joe Biden announced that his son, 1991 College graduate Joseph R. ""Beau"" Biden III had died. Beau Biden graduated with a degree in history from Penn and then attended law school at Syracuse University. While at Penn, he was a member of the fraternity Psi Upsilon, better known as Castle. Biden’s fraternity brothers remember him as a friendly, humble and modest kid. “Everyone knew who he was — his name and status was joked about sometimes, but he was really just a normal guy,” said Eric Garrard, a 1991 College graduate and Biden’s sophomore year roommate.

Biden has lied about his family history. During the 1988 Democratic presidential primary, it emerged that he had plagiarized a speech by British Labour leader Neil Kinnock, adopting Kinnock’s family history as his own. “Why is it that Joe Biden is the first in his family ever to go to a university?” Biden asked. “Is it because I’m the first Biden in a thousand generations to get a college and a graduate degree? … My ancestors, who worked in the coal mines of northeast Pennsylvania and would come up after 12 hours and play football for four hours?”

Not that Biden did not value schooling. He just preferred it vicariously. He did, after all, marry Jill Jacobs-Biden, AS ’75, CHEP ’06EdD, who acquired four degrees, including a doctorate in educational leadership. Either way, the University of Delaware got Joe and Jill Biden where they wanted to go, toward a commitment to a better day.

The 2008 election season brought recognition, headier than anything before, to Joe and Jill Biden and their intertwined relationship with the University of Delaware. The University has been an incubator for governors, senators and judges, for Rhodes Scholars, for a Super Bowl quarterback in Rich Gannon and even for a 19th century secretary of state in Louis McLane, who attended a forerunner called Newark College. The honor roll of alumni became more impressive still when Barack Obama reached down, deus ex machina, and drew Joe Biden–a six-term senator who chairs the Foreign Relations Committee–onto the Democrats’ national ticket for vice president.

Joe Biden’s higher education story is quintessential. After graduating from the exclusive Archmere Academy, a private school in his hometown of Claymont, Delaware, the former vice president and current Democratic presidential candidate pushed his way through undergraduate and eventually law school, meeting his first wife along the way. At Archmere, Biden was a standout student and leader amongst his peers. He was elected class president both his junior and senior years. And on the athletic field, Biden was equally, if not more, impressive. As a three-sport athlete and star halfback, he led Archmere’s football team to an undefeated season his senior year. “Blessed with boyish charm, athletic agility, a dazzling smile, and the quick and overflowing gift of gab, young Joe tap danced through an elite Catholic prep school,” Jules Witcover, a long-time political journalist wrote in his biography “Joe Biden, A Life of Trial and Redemption.”

Biden was particularly intrigued by the range of courses his great-grandfather took, from chemistry to religion to surveying. He recalled that he was inspecting precious items owned by his late mother last year when he discovered more than 100 poems written by Edward Blewitt, a civil engineer who became a Pennsylvania state senator. Caroline Lang ’13, president of Student Government, introduced Biden in Kirby Sports Center. After his address, he was presented with a fine reproduction print of a lithograph depicting the campus in about 1875, the year Edward Blewitt entered the College.

Yanzhong Huang, a senior fellow for Global Health at the Council on Foreign Relations, recently wrote an article for Foreign Affairs that is dismissive of conspiracy theories about the origins of the pandemic but also mentions circumstantial evidence that supports the possibility that a lab release was involved. That evidence includes a study “conducted by the South China University of Technology, [that] concluded that the coronavirus ‘probably’ originated in the Wuhan Center for Disease Control and Prevention,” located just 280 meters from the Hunan Seafood Market often cited as the source of the original outbreak. “The paper was later removed from ResearchGate, a commercial social-networking site for scientists and researchers to share papers,” Huang wrote. “Thus far, no scientists have confirmed or refuted the paper’s findings.”

Wuhan was known to collect bats and study their SARS-family viruses. A virus the result of “serial passage” animal breeding would have no trace of genetic modification because it wouldn’t have any. The most damning evidence in favor of lab origin is, ironically, China’s draconian “sanitizing” of the lab after the outbreak began. Circumstantial evidence points to the Wuhan lab, no gene sequencing needed. I’m still looking for proof they were doing GoF research, preferably with a (hypothetical) SARS-CoV-2 ancestor, selecting for transmissibility.

Professor Richard Ebright of Rutgers University’s Waksman Institute of Microbiology, a biosecurity expert who has been speaking out on lab safety since the early 2000s, does agree with the Nature Medicine authors’ argument that the new coronavirus wasn’t purposefully manipulated by humans, calling their arguments on this score strong. Ebright helped The Washington Post debunk a claim that the COVID-19 outbreak can somehow be tied to bioweapons activity, a conspiracy theory that’s been promoted or endorsed by the likes of US Sen. Tom Cotton, Iran’s supreme leader, and others. But Ebright thinks that it is possible the COVID-19 pandemic started as an accidental release from a laboratory such as one of the two in Wuhan that are known to have been studying bat coronaviruses. Except for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, two deadly viruses that have caused outbreaks in the past, coronaviruses have been studied at laboratories that are labelled as operating at a moderate biosafety level known as BSL-2, Ebright says.

Scientists who have studied the issue maintain that the virus originated in an animal, and probably entered the human population in November. The first human cases were detected in and around Wuhan, and most people had contact with the animal market, though not all, Ben Embarek said.

But the pangolin theory has not been conclusively proven. Some experts wonder whether a virus under study at a lab could have been accidentally released, something that’s happened in the past. Among the latest entrants to the debate about the provenance of SARS-CoV-2 are the authors of a March 17 Nature Medicine piece that takes a look at the virus’s characteristics—including the sites on the virus that allow it to bind to human cells. They looked at whether the virus was engineered by humans and present what appears to be convincing evidence it was not. They also considered the possibility that the outbreak could have resulted from an inadvertent lab release of a virus under study but concluded “we do not believe that any type of laboratory-based scenario is plausible.”

But “we really don’t know” how accurate the origin story is, she says: “There’s some sort of connection [to the Wuhan market] and there were people exposed to the market that were infected.” Baker says what is “very likely” is that the virus originated in a bat. “It’s a likely scenario but we will never know.

Spanish remains the language most frequently spoken by English-learners in U.S. schools by a wide margin, with roughly 76 percent of the nation’s 5 million English-learners speaking Spanish, but the numbers for several other languages are surging. Overall, Spanish, Arabic, Chinese, Vietnamese, and Somali were the top five languages spoken by English-language learners in the nation’s K-12 public schools during the 2016-17 school year, according to recently released data from the U.S. Department of Education. The percentage of Arabic-speaking English-learners, the second-largest group, has increased 75 percent over the past eight years to 122,000.

It should be pointed out that immigrants are more likely to send their children to public school than are natives. As a result, foreign-language students comprise a somewhat larger share of students in public schools than they do of the overall school-age population. 4 Of the native-born who speak a language other than English at home, 10.3 million or 34.9 percent are ages 5-17; the remaining 65.1 percent (19.3 million) are adults.

English was the third most commonly reported home language (124,900 students), which may reflect students who live in multilingual households or students adopted from other countries who were raised speaking another language but currently live in households where English is spoken. The next most commonly reported home languages of ELs in fall 2020 were Chinese (93,300 students), Vietnamese (73,100 students), Portuguese (43,400 students), Russian (37,200 students), Haitian (30,100 students), Hmong (28,700 students), and Urdu (25,200 students).
		

What is the percentage of students in US schools who speak Spanish as their primary language according to the most recent and reliable data?		
The percentage of white students fell from 61% to 49%, according to the National Center for Education Statistics. Federal law requires districts to identify students with limited English skills and to serve them with an equitable, research-based program. Practices vary widely between states and districts. Some schools use transitional bilingual programs, which teach academics such as science, math and social studies in Spanish for a few years before transitioning students to mainstream classes.
		

What is the percentage of students in US schools who speak Spanish as their primary language according to the most recent and reliable data?		
Overall, about 40 million people in the U.S. speak Spanish at home, making it the country’s second-most spoken language. At the same time, growth in the number of Spanish-speaking Hispanics has slowed, according to the Center’s analysis of U.S. Census Bureau data. As a result, the share of Hispanics who speak Spanish at home has declined, while the share that speaks only English at home has increased, especially among children. These trends are expected to continue as Hispanics born in the U.S. increasingly drive the group’s population growth, in large part due to slowing immigration from Mexico (and, to a lesser extent, high intermarriage rates).
		

What is the percentage of students in US schools who speak Spanish as their primary language according to the most recent and reliable data?		
Not only do nearly all Hispanic adults have a personal connection to Spanish, they also express a desire for the language to live on: 88% say it is important to them that future generations of Hispanics living in the U.S. be able to speak Spanish, with vast majorities holding this view across generations. The Center’s 2015 survey findings also show that Spanish dominance is on the decline among second- and third-generation Latinos. While 61% of Hispanic immigrants in the U.S. are Spanish dominant (and another 32% are bilingual), the share who are Spanish dominant drops to 6% among second-generation Hispanics and to less than 1% among third or higher generation Hispanics. Meanwhile, the share of Hispanics who are English dominant rises across generations: Just 7% of immigrant Hispanics are English dominant, a share that rises to 75% among third-generation Hispanics.
		

What is the percentage of students in US schools who speak Spanish as their primary language according to the most recent and reliable data?		
U.S. Latinos say it’s important for future generations of Hispanics to speak Spanish, and the vast majority speak the language to their children. However, the share of Latino parents who ensure the language lives on with their children declines as their immigrant connections become more distant, according to a new Pew Research Center analysis. Overall, 85% of Latino parents say they speak Spanish to their children, according to the Center’s 2015 National Survey of Latinos. Among immigrant parents, nearly all (97%) say they do this. But the share drops to 71% among U.S.-born second-generation Latino parents (those with at least one immigrant parent).
		

What is the percentage of students in US schools who speak Spanish as their primary language according to the most recent and reliable data?		
About 70% of all Hispanic parents say they provide such encouragement often, but again, successive generations are less likely than immigrant parents to say they do this. Spanish has long been a part of life for today’s Latino adults. Nine-in-ten (90%) say Spanish was spoken in their home when they were growing up, and 81% say their parents often or sometimes encouraged them to speak Spanish when growing up. (Notably, 20% of Latino adults say their parents often or sometimes discouraged them from speaking Spanish when growing up.) Today, nearly all Latinos (96%) say their parents speak Spanish, and unlike some other language measures, this share holds relatively steady across generations.

Minneapolis Council Moves To Defund Police, Establish 'Holistic' Public Safety Force The Minneapolis City Council on Friday unanimously approved a proposal to eliminate the city's police department, marking the first step toward establishing a new ""holistic"" approach to public safety. The move follows more than a month of national outrage and protests against police brutality in the wake of the killing of George Floyd, a Black man who died after an officer pressed his knee into his neck for more than eight minutes. The City Council advanced a proposed ballot measure today asking voters to create a new Department of Community Safety and Violence Prevention.

By Alicia Kubas, Malaika Grant, Katherine Nelsen, and Jenny McBurney In May, George Floyd was killed by a Minneapolis police officer while in police custody. The actions of the police officer shed light on the repeated unnecessary use of force for non-violent offenses and non-emergency calls. In the wake of weeks of protests, several Minneapolis City Council members have said they will vote to “defund” the Minneapolis Police Department. However, it can be unclear what defunding the police means and what level of reform this type of change could entail.

- Here is what these groups, council members, and police-reform experts say could happen. The Minneapolis City Council on Sunday pledged to defund the city's police department, following the killing of George Floyd and claims stretching back decades that the department deploys excessive force. ""Our efforts at incremental reform have failed. Period,"" Lisa Bender, the president of the City Council, said at a rally on Sunday. Bender said that the council did not have a specific plan for how to replace the Minneapolis Police Department but that it would work with local communities to find a solution.

America's 'most dangerous city' defunded its police department 7 years ago. It's been a stunning success. Editor's Note: An earlier version of this story featured a photo from Camden, South Carolina. It has since been corrected. One of the most popular calls to action by protesters in America's streets after George Floyd was murdered by a Minneapolis, Minnesota police officer is to ""defund the police."" The city of Minneapolis took the call to heart and a veto-proof supermajority of city council members have approved a plan to defund and dismantle the city's police department.

On June 7, Minneapolis City Council members announced their intent to disband the Minneapolis Police Department (MPD) and create a new, radical form of public safety in the city. This news comes in the wake of George Floyd’s death at the hands of the Minneapolis police on May 25, which caused countless people across the country and the globe to demand that U.S. police forces be defunded and abolished. Though Minneapolis is the only city with a concrete plan to fully disband its police force amid 2020’s nationwide uprising (at least one city has made a similar move before), political officials in cities across the country have also cut their police budget or proposed doing so. The decision to disband the Minneapolis police force has been years in the making. Abolitionist groups across the city, led largely by Black queer and trans organizers, have been working with Minneapolis's city council members to abolish the police for some time.

Our efforts at incremental reform have failed, period.” Bender added that the city council is committed to terminating Minneapolis’ relationship with the police force. Heightened concerns—ranging from heavy-handed and abusive police tactics, the militarization of police departments, the staggering amount of money allocated to this area and strong unions—have now been brought into the national spotlight. A movement to defund the police, a concept that calls for taking some or a large amount of money away from the police force and allocating it toward other purposes, has gained more traction than Bender’s call to disband the police altogether. There are people who try to soften the message by saying disbanding doesn’t necessarily mean completely doing away with the police.

Polling places have often been used as political tools to shape the outcome of elections. Officials can reduce the voter participation of certain groups by eliminating polling places, and increase participation in other groups by placing precincts in key neighborhoods. But it’s not just the number of polling places that affect voter outcomes. Moving voters to different voting environments also may affect how they vote. Taking Away Polling PlacesThe number of polling places in a county can have a significant impact on who votes. And changing the location of a polling place, according to a 2011 study in the American Political Science Review, can lower voter turnout.

For example, after Maricopa County, Arizona, reduced its number of polling places by 70 percent during the 2016 primary, voters were forced to wait in line for up to five hours.173 A study from the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies reported that long lines were estimated to have deterred at least 730,000 Americans from voting in the 2012 elections.174 That year, more than 5 million Americans experienced polling place wait times of at least one hour.175 Furthermore, according to a nationwide study, in 2016, roughly 3 percent of people standing in line at voting locations left before they could vote as a result of long lines.176 Polling place closures disproportionately affect communities of color. In 2016, North Carolina had 158 fewer early polling places in 40 counties with large black communities.177 And in Daphne, Alabama, city council members eliminated 3 of the 5 polling places located in a heavily African American district, leaving the number of polling places in majority-white districts largely untouched.178 Polling places were also closed or consolidated in several jurisdictions in Georgia. Seven of the locations that experienced closures were heavily African American, with longtime voters reporting that they would not participate in the 2016 elections due to mobility challenges and difficulty traveling longer distances to new polling places.179 Lack of convenient polling places and registrar offices also has been a problem for Native American would-be voters.

So I set out to answer the question: where is violent crime happening in 2020? While I get the feeling my part of town isn’t quite the chaotic place portrayed in alerts on my phone, violent crime is unquestionably on the rise in Minneapolis as a whole. Citywide there have been 55 murders in 2020, double the pace of 2019. The city’s Black, Indigenous, and immigrant communities are experiencing the worst of the violence. Ward 9 — the place where George Floyd was killed by Minneapolis police and where many businesses were destroyed in the unrest that followed — has seen the sharpest increase.

Property crimes increased by about 11% in 2019, year-over-year, according to data from the St. Paul Police Department. Local data show that in Minneapolis, reports of violent and property crimes climbed in 2019 following a steep drop the year before. In 2018, reports of violent crimes in Minneapolis reached a 28-year low, according to the FBI data. The police department has not released 2019 FBI yet, so it’s not clear how the city’s most recent numbers will stack up.

Despite the success in some North Minneapolis communities, overall crime is up five percent from last year, with 3,111 violent crimes on record. Police noted that although crime rates increased so far through 2014, the city of Minneapolis is still approaching 30-year-lows. This is consistent with national crime rates, which have also tapered off since the 80s and 90s. Elder concluded by saying the war on violent crime is a constant, ever-changing battle.

In 2018, FBI statistics showed a 26% reduction in violent crime compared to the previous year, making it one of the safest years in Minneapolis in decades. Those statistics showed that its smaller and safer neighbor to the east, St. Paul, also saw crime decline from 2017 to 2018, albeit by a more modest 3%. At the same time, violent crimes like homicide and rape fell 8% statewide in that span, marking a 33% decline from the early 1990s crime surge. In St. Paul, a string of recent headline-grabbing shootings has sent city and community leaders scrambling to find solutions to the city's growing gang violence.

Explaining the Recent Homicide Spikes in U.S. Cities: The 'Minneapolis Effect' and the Decline in Proactive Policing 71 Pages Posted: 10 Sep 2020 Last revised: 4 May 2021 Recently major cities across the country have suffered dramatic spikes in homicides. These spikes are remarkably large, suddenly appearing, and widespread. At this rate, 2020 will easily be the deadliest year in America for gun-related homicides since at least 1999, while most other major crime categories are trending stable or slightly downward.

For example, unemployment in May 2008 (4.7 percent) was up 17.5 percent in Minneapolis from May 2007 (4.0 percent). The crime rate last May, however, was down 11.6 percent (5.9 incidents per 1,000 residents) from May 2007 (6.7 per 1,000). This trend has been even more pronounced over the past five months: · October 2008 unemployment levels were up 31.0 percent from October 2007. The crime rate was down 16.1 percent during these months.

Should the US pay reparations to the descendants of slaves? The issue has been debated for years and has now become a matter of discussion among the candidates vying for the Democratic party’s 2020 presidential nomination. What she has said: “I think that the word, the term reparations, it means different things to different people. But what I mean by it is that we need to study the effects of generations of discrimination and institutional racism and determine what can be done, in terms of intervention, to correct course.” What she has proposed: The Lift Act, a bill introduced by Harris, would provide a universal tax credit to families with an annual income under $100,000 of up to $500 a month.

Kamala Harris says she supports studying reparations, but she's not sure what any resultant program would look like. The senator from California and Democratic presidential hopeful said Sunday during a Des Moines Register editorial board meeting that the idea, which would grant compensation to individuals impacted by slavery and racial discrimination, is complex and deserves to be examined carefully. ""This stuff needs to be studied,"" she said. ""Because America needs a history lesson, to be honest about it, and we need to study it in a way that we are having a very comprehensive and fact-based conversation about policies and the connection between those policies and harm if we're going to have a productive conversation.

The issue of reparations is one that Democratic candidates have embraced so far this cycle, generally pitching policies that aim to address economic inequality. In this interview, though, Harris emphasizes a disparity in health outcomes that she attributes to ""environmental"" rather than genetic factors.

Several Democratic presidential candidates are embracing reparations for the descendants of slaves — but not in the traditional sense. Over the past week, Sen. Kamala Harris of California, Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro spoke of the need for the U.S. government to reckon with and make up for centuries of stolen labor and legal oppression. But instead of backing the direct compensation of African-Americans for the legacy of slavery, the Democratic candidates are talking about using tax credits and other subsidies. Long defined as some type of direct payment to former slaves and their descendants, the shifting definition of reparations comes as White House hopefuls seek to solidify their ties with African-Americans whose support will be crucial to winning the Democratic nomination.

But “unless we’re talking about something that has to be systemic and transfers power to the community, it’s not likely going to be what we would consider reparations,” she said. For now, that’s not how most Democratic presidential contenders are talking about reparations. Harris has proposed monthly payments to qualified citizens of any race in the form of a tax credit. Warren has called for universal child care that would guarantee the benefit from birth until a child enters school. Families with income less than 200 percent of the poverty line would get free access and others would pay no more than 7 percent of their income.

Since then, the conversations surrounding reparations have intensified. Last year it was a hot topic on the campaign trail, with Democratic presidential candidates voicing support for slavery reparations. Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee and former Vice President Joe Biden told The Washington Post he supports studying how reparations could be part of larger efforts to address systemic racism. Biden’s newly appointed running mate, California Sen. Kamala Harris, has co-sponsored a bill that would study the effects of slavery and create recommendations for reparations.

Despite these precedents, Hardball reported that 68% of Americans are opposed to reparations for the descendants of slaves. In fact, reparations have been outright dismissed by otherwise progressive politicians—President Barack Obama didn’t endorse them—or have been “redefined” to mean policies that lower the opportunity gap. Although Senator Harris and Senator Warren told the New York Times that they “support” slavery reparations, they declined to give specific details about what they meant. After giving her statement of support to the Times, Harris told the Grio that she would address reparations in economic policies including tax breaks for low- to middle-class Americans, which includes black families who had been negatively impacted by slavery.

Economist William Darity has also suggested a ""portfolio of reparations"" that would combine payments with black-oriented policies focusing on funding black education, healthcare, and asset building as well as ensuring that public schools properly teaches the full impact of slavery. President Barack Obama never endorsed a reparations policy - nor did 2016 candidate Hillary Clinton - but next year's presidential contenders have been more outspoken, if vague. Senator Kamala Harris has said she is in favour of ""some type"" of reparations. - In February, she told The Grio: ""We have to recognise that everybody did not start out on an equal footing in this country and in particular black people have not.""

Moderator Wolf Blitzer pushed him for a more direct response, noting that multiple presidential candidates have said they support reparations. Sanders answered the question with his own question — one that is now hanging over the 2020 Democratic field: ""What does that mean? What do they mean?

Veteran actor and Samajwadi Party MP Jaya Bachchan has come under attack over her remarks on drug abuse in Bollywood. Amid this, an appeal to boycott the Bachchans has gone viral on social media, purportedly from the Twitter account of actor Mukesh Khanna, who became synonymous with ""Shaktimaan"", an Indian superhero serial aired in the late 90s. The tweet, posted from the handle ""@Real_Khanna1"" with the actor's image on the Twitter profile, says, ""I am boycotting Jaya Bachchan and Amitabh Bachchan. Who is with me???""

Fact Check: Shaktimaan struggles with his fake avatars on social media An appeal to boycott the Bachchans has gone viral on social media, purportedly from the Twitter account of actor Mukesh Khanna, who became synonymous with ""Shaktimaan"". India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that the viral tweet was made by a handle impersonating Khanna. The viral tweet was made by a handle impersonating “Shaktimaan”. Khanna never called for any such boycott.

Khanna has categorically denied his association with any of the four impersonating accounts. He said he is looking for ways to lodge a complaint and take action against the accounts. When India Today asked him about his personal opinion on the boycott calls against some Bollywood stars, Khanna said people should stop watching films of those actors who openly flaunt and support drugs. ""Since it is the public who made us stars, only they can punish those irresponsible actors who are caught taking drugs. At that level, I support boycotting their films,"" added ""Shaktimaan"".

Today the NFL honored the organization that yelled ""hope they die"" outside the mothers hospital.","What is the name of the organization that the NFL reportedly honored, and is there documented evidence of their involvement in the incident outside the hospital?		
While some football players were indeed supporters or leaders of the BLM movement, no evidence linked them or the league with the events in Los Angeles. Any social media post that claimed ""the NFL will honor and praise the organization that stood out outside [the] hospital chanting"" was at best a misleading attempting to connect dots that didn't exist. At worst, it was a purposeful attempt to discredit an initiative by the NFL to recognize systemic racism by erroneously linking it to the gathering outside the California medical facility. Here's What's True About the Shooting of Two LA Deputies
		

What is the name of the organization that the NFL reportedly honored, and is there documented evidence of their involvement in the incident outside the hospital?		
Numerous viewers of the seven-second clip believed the apparent ambush — which sent the deputies to the hospital in critical condition — was a result of the momentum among civil rights activists to eliminate unjust killings of Black Americans by authorities, also known as the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement, as well as supporters of it. Sharing the video with her roughly 2.6 million followers, for example, conservative provocateur Candace Owens wrote on Twitter: ""Why else does this [shooting of deputies] happen? ... BLACK LIVES MATTER AND THE COMPLICIT MEDIA ORGANIZATIONS, ATHLETES, AND ENTERTAINERS ARE TO BLAME."" Below, we unpack that claim — which is ultimately a product of an expansive fear-mongering campaign by deceptive media sources to paint the BLM movement as a social force that doesn't match reality.
		

What is the name of the organization that the NFL reportedly honored, and is there documented evidence of their involvement in the incident outside the hospital?		
We also have no evidence to confirm or disprove the claim that the narrator is an ""activist"" or in any way associated with the BLM movement. Moments after the gunfire, medics took the deputies — whom the department had not identified as of this writing — to the St. Francis Medical Center, where they underwent surgery. The following day, the hospital listed them in stable condition, and they were expected to recover from multiple gunshot wounds. Both Trump and the Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden were quick to condemn the shooting of law enforcement, though their messages varied.
		

What is the name of the organization that the NFL reportedly honored, and is there documented evidence of their involvement in the incident outside the hospital?		
A Group 'That Is Not BLM' Organized the Protest Outside the Hospital In the hours after the shooting, roughly five protesters gathered outside the hospital where the deputies were being treated, and law enforcement officers created a barricade there to supposedly keep the protesters from entering the facility. We uncovered these facts about the scene, primarily based on video evidence: - Several protesters attempted to provoke the officers by shouting at them.
		

What is the name of the organization that the NFL reportedly honored, and is there documented evidence of their involvement in the incident outside the hospital?		
In addition, he said the rumor that protesters were trying to break into the hospital was false. He said: In the news and some white supremacists are saying that there were Black Lives Matter protesters out there, trying to block the driveway of the hospital, the emergency hospital area, and allegedly trying to force their way in to the emergency room. [...] We did not go to force our way in to anywhere. We went out there to deliver a message to these gang-banging sheriff's department that we're not going to shed a tear because two of your gang-banging sheriffs got shot in the head. In sum, a group that is not BLM organized the small protest outside the hospital where two deputies received treatment for gunshot wounds, and tried to provoke law enforcement officers standing guard there.
		

What is the name of the organization that the NFL reportedly honored, and is there documented evidence of their involvement in the incident outside the hospital?		
A handful of anti-police protesters showed up at the hospital where the deputies were being treated, but later dispersed after some tense moments with authorities who were guarding the entrance, KABC reported. PROTESTERS SHOW UP AT LA HOSPITAL TREATING AMBUSHED COPS, SHOUT CHILLING THREATS Protesters were blocking the entrance to the hospital emergency room and yelling, ""We hope they die,"" referring to the two deputies, the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department said. Sutton said he is “sickened” by the shooting of the deputies and the actions of the protesters at the hospital.
		

What is the name of the organization that the NFL reportedly honored, and is there documented evidence of their involvement in the incident outside the hospital?		
Additionally, hours after the Compton shooting, another layer to the controversy emerged: Reports on social media alleged BLM protesters taunted law enforcement officers standing guard outside the hospital where the deputies were receiving medical treatment, and blocked emergency access to the facility: The Epoch Times, a media outlet laden with misinformation that has effectively served to help U.S. President Donald Trump's political agenda since 2016, claimed: ""Black Lives Matter protesters blocked a hospital entrance in Los Angeles on Saturday night and yelled, 'we hope they die,' hours after a man shot two county deputies in an ambush."" Based on our analysis of videos of the shooting and protests, as well as first-person accounts and news reports, these assertions were a blend of fact and distortions of reality — presented in memes such as the one displayed below that aimed to dissuade people against supporting the NFL because of its alleged support for protesters who gathered outside the hospital:

The Board of Supervisors will vote Tuesday on whether to approve the request. https://twitter.com/LASDHQ/status/1305242453704728576 Sheriff Alex Villanueva said Sunday that the deputies “survived the shooting and (are) recovering, a double miracle.” They were being treated at St. Francis Medical Center in Lynwood.
		

What is the name of the organization that the NFL reportedly honored, and is there documented evidence of their involvement in the incident outside the hospital?		
After that shooting, a handful of protesters gathered outside the hospital where the deputies were treated and tried to block the emergency room entrance. Videos from the scene recorded protesters shouting expletives at police and at least one yell “I hope they ... die.” Villanueva said the angry rhetoric is making deputies’ work more difficult. “They’re out there doing their job and yet we have people fanning the flames of hatred and just turning up the volume when we don’t need it.
		

What is the name of the organization that the NFL reportedly honored, and is there documented evidence of their involvement in the incident outside the hospital?		
A gunman shot and wounded two Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies on Sept. 12, 2020. After the shooting, a handful of protesters engaged law enforcement officers standing guard outside the hospital where the injured deputies were receiving medical help. No evidence connected the shooting — or the suspected gunman — to the BLM movement. Also, the founder of an L.A.-based Black rights group took credit for the hospital protest in a Facebook post that explicitly said the group ""is not BLM."" While the sheriff's department said protesters at one point blocked entrances and exits at the hospital, no videos or photos confirmed that was the case. During America's growing political divide over policing, a video surfaced online in September 2020 showing a gunman shooting two Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies in the head as they sat in a squad car.

341,Muslim regiment of the Indian Army had refused to fight in India’s 1965 war with Pakistan.,"Did any official records or credible historical sources document an instance where Muslim regiments of the Indian Army collectively refused to fight during the 1965 India-Pakistan war?		
Standing between Pakistani propaganda and the Indian nation can be a full time job, especially when it comes to issues about Indian Muslims. It is an enshrined doctrine in Pakistan that India’s fault lines will remain its Achilles heel. The recent controversy – generated by crude video clips inserted into social media networks and reinvigoration of a Pakistani media article of March 2010 – is nothing but a ham handed but potentially mischievous campaign by Pakistan’s Inter Services Public Relations (ISPR). It’s an issue very few in India know much about: Indian Muslim presence in India’s armed forces and issues concerning alleged disloyalty to the nation, on which across the board gullibility is very high. The essence of the Pakistani disinformation is that a Muslim Regiment existed in the Indian Army till 1965, but was disbanded because in that conflict 20,000 Muslims refused to fight Pakistan.
		

Did any official records or credible historical sources document an instance where Muslim regiments of the Indian Army collectively refused to fight during the 1965 India-Pakistan war?		
However, sub units comprising only Muslims do exist in many units of the Grenadiers, the Rajputana Rifles, Rajput Regiment and some cavalry regiments. There was no Muslim Regiment ever and certainly not in 1965. But Muslims fighting as part of multi class regiments proved their absolute commitment and worth. Abdul Hamid’s Param Vir Chakra, although a legend, is insufficiently recalled today. Major (later Lt Gen) Mohammad Zaki and Major Abdul Rafey Khan both won the Vir Chakra, the latter posthumously even as he battled the Pakistani division commanded by his uncle, Maj Gen Sahibzada Yaqub Khan. Such were the legends of Muslim warriors in 1965. The same followed in 1971. In later years Muslim bravehearts of the Indian army proved their mettle in Kargil and in fighting terror groups in J&K. Three army commanders, three corps commanders and a number of two star generals make up the community’s share of achievements in higher ranks.
		

Did any official records or credible historical sources document an instance where Muslim regiments of the Indian Army collectively refused to fight during the 1965 India-Pakistan war?		
Thereafter not a single Muslim participated in the 1971 conflict (another lie). Secondly, the percentage of Muslim servicemen as per the article is drastically below the ratio of Muslim population in India. The March 2010 article is more academic, highlighting research by an Indian Muslim scholar in the US who finds no rationale for this or for absence of reservation for Muslims in the armed forces. Such projections obfuscate reality on the ground. Post-Independence, majority of Muslim officers and soldiers migrated to Pakistan, leaving a minuscule minority as the core or seed element of Indian Muslim servicemen distributed in different regiments and units. In that context new Muslim, Christian or Buddhist regiments made no sense as ethnic and regional identity took priority over faith as entities of representation.
		

Did any official records or credible historical sources document an instance where Muslim regiments of the Indian Army collectively refused to fight during the 1965 India-Pakistan war?		
Which is likely why these conflicts have been largely inconclusive. Notable exception being 1971 where Pakistan’s political blunders and logistical challenges gave India an insurmountable edge. What is interesting to me is that there are few “retrospectives” that are in the public domain from Indian officers related to Indo-Pak conflicts. Major Amin has high standards for senior commanders and the fact is that most senior commanders in both armies were not capable of handling large formations.. they had grown up in the British Indian army where that level was the job of British officers. Still, there were exceptions.

I think there is less fascination with the army ( which is changing now) on Indian side then Pakistan. Hardly anyone can name our COAS from the younger generation (and that’s a good thing in my view) . I think the army of both India-Pak are made of same stuff give or take, that’s why having a Rommels would be aberration. Indian officers do have memoirs and stuff, just that no body really reads them apart from military types. “in the case of India, even a major general who ran and hid in some sugar cane fields (Lahore 1965) and the less said about Pakistan’s armored div commanders in Assal Uttar the better”

Fact check: AARP maintains nonpartisan stance, makes no political donations The claim: A portion of AARP customer payments go to Democrats As election season goes into high gear, the spread of misinformation about campaign donations and party affiliations is in keeping up, with some of the most frequent targets being large companies and organizations. Accusations that AARP makes political donations have made the rounds on social media.
		

What are AARP's official policies and regulations regarding their involvement in political campaigns, and are there any documented instances of AARP spending money on TV ads targeting specific political candidates?		
AARP policy prohibits employees or officers from engaging in any personal political activity using AARP resources or during work hours. According to campaign finance data tracked by Open Secrets, individual donors associated with AARP made a total of $96,381 in political contributions as of this writing in the 2020 federal election cycle, the majority (87.45%) of those donations going to Democratic candidates. Massoglia said that as a 501(c)4 organization, the AARP is allowed under U.S. tax code to engage in some political campaign activity. But their activities have been issue-oriented and bipartisan. For example, a 2018 AARP ad praised U.S. President Donald Trump on drug pricing policy.

Justice Department Secures Agreement with North Carolina Printing Company to Resolve Claims of Immigration-related Discrimination The Justice Department announced today that it reached a settlement with McDonald’s USA LLC and its corporate affiliates and subsidiaries (McDonald’s) resolving allegations that McDonald’s discriminated against immigrant employees of McDonald’s-owned restaurants. The department’s Office of Special Counsel for Immigration-Related Unfair Employment Practices (OSC) opened its investigation based on information received on its worker hotline. The investigation found that McDonald’s had a longstanding practice of requiring lawful permanent residents to show a new permanent resident card when their original document expired, even though the law prohibits this practice.

Ten former McDonald’s workers in Virginia have filed a federal civil rights lawsuit against the fast-food chain, claiming that supervisors threw racial and sexual slurs at them, then fired them because the stores had “too many black people”. The employees say they overheard their supervisors talk about the “need to get the ghetto out of the store”, and “get rid of the niggers and the Mexicans”. Out of the 10 plaintiffs – all of whom were fired in May 2014 – nine are African American and one is Hispanic. They filed a complaint in the US district court for the western district of Virginia against McDonald’s, as well as Michael Simon, the owner of the three franchises where they worked.

Have McDonald's publicly announced any policy or actions related to taking down American flags at their restaurants in support of Black Lives Matter or antifa groups?		
McDonald’s said it will comment after it has seen the lawsuit. It said: “McDonald’s has a long-standing history of embracing the diversity of employees, independent franchisees, customers and suppliers, and discrimination is completely inconsistent with our values. McDonald’s and our independent owner-operators share a commitment to the well-being and fair treatment of all people who work in McDonald’s restaurants”. McDonald’s has generally maintained a “hands-off” policy towards franchisees. Last year, however, the National Labor Relations Board ruled that McDonald’s could be held liable for labor violations at its franchises. Staff members say they were told they were good workers, but that they “didn’t fit the profile” of desirable employees.

[7] Interviews with workers suggest that McDonald’s is not sufficiently training staff or equipping its stores consistently with violence hazard controls, such as cash handling procedures, necessary visibility, panic buttons accessible to all staff, and safe drive-thru windows to prevent violence or at least minimize the number and severity of such incidents. Late-night hours, lack of training, and a lack of adequate hazard controls—combined with hundreds of reported violent incidents, and worker accounts of violence across the country—implicate McDonald’s in dangerous workplace neglect. McDonald’s is the largest fast food company in the United States and the world.[8] In 2018, its nearly 14,000 U.S. stores generated $38.5 billion in sales, accounting for approximately 15 percent of all fast food sales in the country.[9] McDonald’s is the second-largest private sector employer in the United States and the world, with 1.9 million employees globally.[10]McDonald’s franchises 95 percent of its U.S. stores.[11] As the franchisor, McDonald’s exerts a high level of control over its franchisees’ operations, with detailed rules for all aspects of store design and operations, including required operating procedures, methods of inventory control, bookkeeping and accounting, days and hours of operation, business practices and policies, and advertising, among others.[12] McDonald’s is also one of the biggest real estate companies in the world. Under conventional franchising agreements, McDonald’s, in nearly all instances, owns or leases the land and buildings, which it leases or subleases to franchisees.[13]

McDonald’s does exercise control over its franchises, insists Smith.

Smith also points out that franchise owners, managers and supervisors undergo “rigorous training on how to follow corporate directives on matters that include discrimination, diversity and harassment.” “McDonald’s corporate is apparently trying to have best of both worlds ... all the control and profit, and none of the responsibility,” he says. “Unfortunately for McDonald’s, we don’t think the law works that way.”

Today. Our world is different. This debate is different. A global pandemic has turned our lives upside down and killed over 215,000 Americans. And tonight's different because of the plexiglass that's separating Dan Forest in me. And is there because for the last eight months, including last night Dan Forest has been having in person events with no mask or social distancing, that's reckless. And it endangers North Carolinians, including the staff in this room, leaving our neighbors in harm's way and risking lives. That's not the North Carolina way, overcoming challenges and taking care of one another. That's the North Carolina I know.

347,"Tourism, lockdown key to deep New Zealand recession.","What were the key economic factors that contributed to New Zealand's recession during the specified period, and how significant was the impact of tourism and lockdown measures compared to other factors?		
Before COVID-19, tourism was New Zealand's largest export industry and delivered $40.9 billion to the country. Tourism made a significant positive impact on regional economies supporting employment by directly employing 8.4 percent (229,566 people) of the New Zealand workforce.

The quick-start tutorials are updated at each software release. For the best experience, use an online help version that matches your software version. Tourism is an important part of New Zealand's economy. For the fiscal year that ended in March 2020, tourism made up 5.5 percent of the country's gross domestic product (GDP) and is a major employer. Knowing where tourists come from, which parts of New Zealand they visit, and how long they stay helps planners choose the right locations for hotels, tour companies, and other services. Using data from New Zealand's International Visitor Survey, you'll visualize increases in the Chinese tourism market in New Zealand over a 20-year period prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Sharon Zollner, chief economist at ANZ in Auckland, said at NZCMF that countries which have successfully controlled the virus have shown a better rebound in economic activity. This still means less bad, rather than outright good, performance: Zollner said the only reward for dealing well with the health crisis is a recession. “The economy had a surge immediately after the first lockdown ended as there was pent up spending capacity,” she added. “But we are going into a recession due to the loss of tourism. Alhough this will not be fully felt until the end of the year, businesses know it is coming and are reflecting it in their intentions and expectations for investment, employment and profits.”
		

What were the key economic factors that contributed to New Zealand's recession during the specified period, and how significant was the impact of tourism and lockdown measures compared to other factors?		
With a population of over 4 million, travel and tourism contributes to 25% of its workforce. Tourist-centric countries remain the hardest hit from global travel bans, but the world’s biggest economies are also feeling the impact. In Spain, tourism ranks as the third highest contributor to its economy. If lockdowns remain in place until September, it is projected to lose $68 billion (€62 billion) in revenues. On the other hand, South Korea is impacted the least: just 2.8% of its GDP is reliant on tourism.

What were the key economic factors that contributed to New Zealand's recession during the specified period, and how significant was the impact of tourism and lockdown measures compared to other factors?		
In many countries, glaciers are also intimately linked to the tourism industry, yet to date, only a few studies have explored the potential impact that glacier recession will have on this often important economic earner (eg Wang et al 2010; Ritter et al 2012); this research focuses mainly on the ski industry (eg Bürki et al 2005; Fischer et al 2011; Hendrikx et al 2012) and potential changes to visitor numbers and experiences (eg Scott et al 2007). New Zealand has over 3100 glaciers (Chinn 1999), and although fewer than 1% of these glaciers are utilized for tourism operations, 3 are intensively utilized: the Tasman, Fox, and Franz Josef Glaciers (Figure 1). Glacier-related tourism in New Zealand dates back to the late 1880s. With the establishment of the Hermitage Hotel at Aoraki/Mount Cook, visitors began going for guided glacier walks on the then very accessible Tasman Glacier (Figure 2), and guiding services were first advertised in a local newspaper in February 1884 (Pearce 1980; Tourism New Zealand 2001; Langton 2011). Initially, guiding operations on the western glaciers were less formal. Peter Graham (who would later become lead guide at Mount Cook) started exploring the broken ice of the Franz Josef Glacier with his brother Alex, cutting steps with a prospecting (miner's) pick around 1902.

In Mexico, losses to structures and other infrastructure have not become a serious problem. While there are population centers within the forest areas that could be impacted by fires, they are usually surrounded by farming zones or the fuel loads have been reduced enough so that fires do not burn very intensely, if at all. The principal negative impacts from fires are to natural resources and forest industry. 
		

Have there been documented instances of significant wildfires impacting regions in Mexico or Canada in recent years?		
Requesting assistance from other countries in North America may have seemed like an obvious solution, but managing fires across borders isn’t always straightforward. Wildland fire is managed differently in Canada, the United States, and Mexico, and each country has its own fire danger rating system. The countries also use different units of measure and fire forecast products. This means a fire considered as ""significant"" in the United States might receive a different classification in Canada or Mexico.

Have there been documented instances of significant wildfires impacting regions in Mexico or Canada in recent years?		
Mexico has many issues that complicate its wildland fire management programme. There is a lack of  public understanding regarding complexities of the wildfire problem. Many communities use fire for  forestry, farming, or livestock purposes but others see fire as a problem to be totally eliminated from the forests. This translates into a lack of understanding by the public of the full range of issues of

Justin Gray Liverman was sentenced to five years in federal prison and Andrew Otto Boggs was sentenced to two years. Other co-conspirators were located in the United Kingdom and were prosecuted by the Crown Prosecution Service.[78] Brennan helped establish the FBI’s counterintelligence investigation of Donald Trump’s campaign, which included the use of foreign intelligence, during the period leading up to the 2016 presidential election.[79]

On August 19, Brennan told the host of NBC's Meet the Press that he was considering legal action to prevent Trump from doing the same to others.[97] The New York Times reported in May 2019 that the administration had not followed through on the bureaucratic process to revoke Brennan's clearance.[98] In March 2019, attorney general Bill Barr appointed United States Attorney for the District of Connecticut John Durham to investigate the origins of the FBI Crossfire Hurricane investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 elections, which involved some Trump associates.[99] In December 2019, The New York Times reported that Durham was specifically scrutinizing Brennan's role.[100][101]

President-elect Trump stated his intention to keep Comey as the FBI director.

He also refuted Trump's allegations that the Obama administration had wiretapped him.[35] During the weeks leading up to May 9, grand jury subpoenas were issued by the U.S. Attorney's Office in Alexandria, Virginia, to associates of Michael Flynn for the purpose of obtaining records relating to the investigation of Russia's role in the election.

James Comey, the seventh director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), was fired by U.S. President Donald Trump on May 9, 2017.[1] Comey had been criticized in 2016 for his handling of the FBI's investigation of the Hillary Clinton email controversy and in 2017 for the FBI's investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. elections as it related to alleged collusion with Trump's presidential campaign.[2][3] Trump dismissed Comey by way of a termination letter in which he stated that he was acting on the recommendation of Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein.[4][5][6] In the following days, he gave numerous explanations of the dismissal that contradicted his staff and also belied the initial impression that Sessions and Rosenstein had influenced his decision.[7][8] Trump publicly stated that he had already decided to fire Comey;[9] it later emerged that he had written his own early draft of the termination letter,[10] and had solicited the Rosenstein memo the day before citing it.[11]

350,The rate of abortions under Democratic presidential administrations has actually fallen more precipitously.,"What are the specific abortion rates during Democratic and Republican presidential administrations, and how do they compare when adjusted for other influencing factors such as changes in state laws, access to healthcare, and socioeconomic conditions?		
Information in this report on the number of abortions performed through different methods (e.g., medical or curettage) and at different gestational ages provides the denominator data that are necessary for analyses of the relative safety of abortion practices. Finally, information on the number of pregnancies ending in abortion are needed in conjunction with data on births and fetal losses to more accurately estimate the number of pregnancies in the United States and determine rates for various outcomes of public health importance (e.g., adolescent pregnancies) (43,80). According to the most recent national estimates from 2010, 18% of all pregnancies in the United States end in abortion (81). Multiple factors influence the incidence of abortion. These factors include access to health care services, including contraception (82–84); the availability of abortion providers (14,15,85–87); state regulations, such as mandatory waiting periods (88), parental involvement laws (89), and legal restrictions on abortion providers (90,91); increasing acceptance of nonmarital childbearing (92,93); shifts in the racial/ethnic composition of the U.S. population (94,95); and changes in the economy and the resulting impact on fertility preferences and use of contraception (96,97).

Among these same 47 areas, the annual rate of decrease fitted from the regression analysis was greater during 2009–2013 than during 2004–2008 for all three measures of abortion.

Abortion ratios also decreased from 2007 to 2013.

This is a decline of 1.2% from 819,353 legal induced abortions reported in 2004. A total of 820,151 legal induced abortions were reported to CDC by 49 reporting areas. This change represents a 2.3% decline from 2004, for which 49 areas reported 839,226 legal induced abortions (Tables 1 and 2). The only difference between these 2 years was that West Virginia did not report in 2004 and Louisiana did not report in 2005. Therefore, changes between these two years must be interpreted with that difference in mind. Overall, the annual number of legal induced abortions in the United States increased gradually from 1973 until it peaked in 1990, and it generally declined thereafter (Figure 1).

Among the 31 reporting areas**** that provided these data for the relevant years of comparison (2004 versus 2013, 2004 versus 2008, 2009 versus 2013, and 2012 versus 2013), the percentage of abortions among unmarried women increased 3% from 2004 to 2013 (from 82.6% to 85.3%). The increase from 2004 to 2008 (2%) was larger than the increase from 2009 to 2013 (<1%). Among married women, the abortion ratio decreased 22% from 2004 to 2013 (from 58 to 45 abortions per 1,000 live births), with a larger decrease occurring from 2009 to 2013 (15%) than from 2004 to 2008 (5%). Among unmarried women, the abortion ratio decreased 18% from 2004 to 2013 (from 472 to 389 abortions per 1,000 live births), with a larger decrease also occurring from 2009 to 2013 (11%) than from 2004 to 2008 (5%). Data from the 41 areas that reported the number of previous live births for women who obtained abortions in 2013 indicate that 40.2%, 45.6%, and 14.1% of these women had zero, one to two, or three or more previous live births, respectively (Table 16).

However, the rate of decline varied depending on the demographics of women, such as age, race and ethnicity, and income. It is important to note that both public opinion research toward abortion and population estimates of the abortion are often based on survey data. This type of studies often carries a profound policy making impact when policies are informed by findings of public opinion survey research. Given that, research on the measurement of the relevant questions will benefit the understanding of public opinion as it relates to abortion.
		

What are the specific abortion rates during Democratic and Republican presidential administrations, and how do they compare when adjusted for other influencing factors such as changes in state laws, access to healthcare, and socioeconomic conditions?		
Following nationwide legalization of abortion in 1973, the total number, rate (number of abortions per 1,000 women aged 15–44 years), and ratio (number of abortions per 1,000 live births) of reported abortions increased rapidly, reaching the highest levels in the 1980s before decreasing at a slow yet steady pace (2–4). However, the incidence of abortion has varied considerably across demographic subpopulations (5–10). Moreover, during 2006–2008, a break occurred in the previously sustained pattern of decrease (11–14), although this break has been followed in all subsequent years by even greater decreases (15–19). Continued surveillance is needed to monitor long-term changes in the incidence of abortion in the United States. Each year, CDC requests tabulated data from the central health agencies of 52 reporting areas (the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and New York City) to document the number and characteristics of women obtaining legal induced abortions in the United States.

Description of System: For each year since 1969, CDC has compiled abortion data by state or area of occurrence. Information is requested each year from all 50 states, New York City, and the District of Columbia. For 2005, data were received from 49 reporting areas: New York City, District of Columbia, and all states except California, Louisiana, and New Hampshire. For the purpose of trends analysis, data were evaluated from the 46 reporting areas that have been consistently reported since 1995. Results: A total of 820,151 legal induced abortions were reported to CDC for 2005 from 49 reporting areas, the abortion ratio (number of abortions per 1,000 live births) was 233, and the abortion rate was 15 per 1,000 women aged 15--44 years.

353,The UK public won’t be able to claim compensation if unlicensed vaccines damage our health.,"What specific legal provisions or guidelines are in place regarding the UK's policy on compensation for health damages caused by unlicensed vaccines?		
A Facebook post has drawn attention to an extract from a Sun article, which states that manufacturers of a potential fast-tracked Covid-19 vaccine would be protected from civil liability if the vaccine is later found to cause harm. UK law does not usually allow the sale or supply of medicinal products, including vaccines, without marketing authorisation (product licensing). However, this doesn’t apply when the sale or supply of a medicinal product is temporarily authorised in response to “pathogenic agents” such as the virus which causes Covid-19. So the government could authorise the supply of an unlicensed Covid-19 vaccine, although, to be clear, unlicensed does not mean untested.
		

What specific legal provisions or guidelines are in place regarding the UK's policy on compensation for health damages caused by unlicensed vaccines?		
This is a part of EU law which has been implemented into UK law. However, the government consultation document also states that the law “does not provide complete immunity from civil liability.” If the product is not found to meet safety standards or is defective, then there is a liability. One of the scientists working on a potential vaccine has stated that, while processes have been sped up, this doesn’t mean steps to ensure safety have been missed.
		

What specific legal provisions or guidelines are in place regarding the UK's policy on compensation for health damages caused by unlicensed vaccines?		
Any Covid-19 vaccine rolled out to the public, unlicensed or not, will still go through clinical trials. Licensing usually takes place after a vaccine has undergone various trials and can typically take weeks or even months. Any decision to fast track unlicensed vaccines would be a decision made nationally and not by individual suppliers. Manufacturers “cannot generally be sued in the civil courts for the consequences resulting from the use of an unlicensed product, or a new use of a licensed product, that a national licensing authority is recommending in order to deal with certain specific health threats”, according to a government consultation document.
		

What specific legal provisions or guidelines are in place regarding the UK's policy on compensation for health damages caused by unlicensed vaccines?		
Further guidance around what a breach of these standards would mean, or how it would be assessed is currently being consulted on. It has also been recently reported that at least one potential Covid-19 vaccine manufacturer, AstraZeneca, has been exempted from future product liability claims with most of the countries it has supply agreements with. The article states it is not clear which specific countries this is, but it does have a supply agreement with Britain.

Has the Nigerian Government officially announced or implemented a ban on the sale and distribution of alcohol in sachet and polythene packaging as of the most recent updates?		
Unfortunately, Nigeria has not made much progress in articulating and implementing policies to decrease harmful alcohol use. According to the WHO Global status reports on health and alcohol, Nigeria has no comprehensive, stand-alone policy document to regulate the production, advertisement, availability and promotion of alcohol in line with WHO recommendations. Furthermore, there are no national and state level monitoring systems to track alcohol consumption and monitor its health and social consequences [9] despite the country’s contribution and approval of the declarations at the 2008 World Health Assembly [12].

Has the Nigerian Government officially announced or implemented a ban on the sale and distribution of alcohol in sachet and polythene packaging as of the most recent updates?		
According to the views expressed by the respondents, many Nigerian cultures permit the use of alcohol thus constituting a limitation for the enforcement of the implementation of the FRSC act. Studies have also documented that the Alcohol Industry has leveraged on the influence of this permissive culture for alcohol consumption coupled with custom and traditions which permit its use as a promotion strategy in Nigeria [12, 26]. An example is the advertisement of Seamans Schnapps as a libation drink. Also on a similar note, Orijin, an herbal alcoholic drink was introduced and launched across Nigeria in the palaces of traditional rulers [26]. These findings reveal the significant challenge linked to the permissive cultural inclination for use of alcohol which has been identified as a challenge for the implementation of the 2007 FRSC act and a bane for the formulation of stronger legislation to curtail the unsafe use of alcohol in Nigeria.
		

Has the Nigerian Government officially announced or implemented a ban on the sale and distribution of alcohol in sachet and polythene packaging as of the most recent updates?		
The Nigerian cultural and traditional milieu is favorably inclined and perpetuates alcohol use and within this context, it is difficult for government agencies to formulate, implement and enforce strong alcohol control legislation. The alcohol industry leverages this favorable milieu by advertising alcohol in a cultural context; promoting it as a beverage associated with culture and celebration thus exacerbating the situation and unwittingly undermining the policy formulation and weakening the implementation processes. To address this, there is a need for a cultural re-orientation and strong policies that note the traditional and social relevance of alcohol but deformalize its harmful use. Furthermore, Nigeria is beleaguered with myriads of health and development challenges and alcohol control does not top the priority of policy imperatives.

Beyond the Nigerian government, International Center for Alcohol PoliciesFootnote 1 [ICAP] (a non- governmental organization recognized and sponsored by global alcohol producers) had worked with the Beer Sector Group of Manufacturers Association and the Advertising Practitioners Council of Nigeria to advocate for self-regulation [23]. Policy content of existing policies and best buys addressed Findings from the document review of the 2013 and 2015 National Policy and Strategic Plan of Action on Non-Communicable Diseases showed that six actions are proposed to limit the harmful use of alcohol. Specifically, they are–“discourage alcohol use among women; prevent underage alcohol consumption; discourage binge drinking with consumption of toxic local brew; prevent consumption of illegally brewed and distributed alcoholic beverages; prevent driving or operating machinery under alcohol influence and identify and manage alcohol use disorders”
		

Has the Nigerian Government officially announced or implemented a ban on the sale and distribution of alcohol in sachet and polythene packaging as of the most recent updates?		
Overall, alcohol currently has no holistic, health-sector led policy document to regulate the marketing, promotion of alcohol and accessibility. A major barrier is the low government budgetary allocation to support the process. Nigeria has few alcohol-related policies with weak multi-sectoral action. Funding constraint remains a major threat to the implementation and enforcement of proposed policy actions. The health, social and economic costs of alcohol-related harm and diseases are well-documented [1,2,3,4] and over 3 million deaths have been attributed to alcohol intake every year [4].
		

Has the Nigerian Government officially announced or implemented a ban on the sale and distribution of alcohol in sachet and polythene packaging as of the most recent updates?		
Overdependence on donor funding and poor government budgetary allocation are major barriers to alcohol control in Nigeria. Recommendations: The policy actions on alcohol prevention and control in the existing NCD policies should be reviewed and updated by the NCD committee in line with global recommendations proposed by World Health Organization (2010) global strategy to reduce the harmful use of alcohol [13] with emphasis on best buy interventions using MSA. Besides, legal acts should be formulated and ratified to regulate the activities of the alcohol industries.

Has the Nigerian Government officially announced or implemented a ban on the sale and distribution of alcohol in sachet and polythene packaging as of the most recent updates?		
Unfortunately, the neglect of the alcohol policy has an extensive history; successive Nigerian governments continue to avoid the regulation of harmful alcohol use [27]. To surmount this challenge, there is need to learn lessons from the relatively successful tobacco control effort in Nigeria which was characterized by the high level of multi-sectoral action and activism by civil society organizations, government and professional organizations [28]. Other barriers documented were overdependence on financial assistance and grants from donor organizations to fund alcohol policy formulation and implementation activities coupled with the minimal or absent of government budgetary allocation to support the process. A typical initiative which reflects Nigeria is overdependence on donor organizations for funding its alcohol control initiatives is the “drink responsibly” campaign by brewers.

Rather, preliminary discussions are ongoing which might lead to policy formulation. This finding is substantiated by quotes from key informant interviewees as outlined below:

What do antifa, Nov. 4, and riots have in common? They inspire conspiracy theories, it seems. A circulated screenshot of an August 2020 Facebook post called on “antifa comrades” to disguise themselves as supporters of U.S. President Donald Trump. By wearing Make America Great Again (MAGA) hats, U.S. flags, and even a “convincing” police uniform, the post claimed, ""comrades"" could deceive police and news media into thinking Trump supporters, not antifa, were rioting on Nov. 4, 2020, a day after the U.S. presidential election. Snopes readers shared a screenshot of this flyer and asked us to look into whether it was actually connected to antifa groups:
		

Is there credible evidence from reliable sources that Antifa was actively recruiting individuals to dress as President Trump supporters and police to riot on Election Day 2020 in the United States?		
We found no evidence of violent, antifa-led insurrections occurring in the U.S. on Nov. 4 over the past few years. On Nov. 4, 2017, there were anti-Trump rallies organized around the country by leftist groups, but these were far cries from cases of ""rioting."" In New York City, for example, around 300 people showed up, leaflets were distributed, and only a handful of Trump supporters turned up to counterdemonstrate, according to news reports. Because the source of the above-displayed post confirmed to us it was shared as a joke, rumors of Nov. 4 activity have been disavowed by known antifa media outlets in the past, and we found that this meme had no connection to actual antifa activities, we rate this claim as “False.”
		

Is there credible evidence from reliable sources that Antifa was actively recruiting individuals to dress as President Trump supporters and police to riot on Election Day 2020 in the United States?		
Antifa comrades! On Nov. 4 don’t forget to disguise yourselves as patriots/Trump supporters: wear MAGA hats, USA flags, 3%er insignias, a convincing police uniform is even better! This way police and patriots responding to us won’t know who their enemies are, and onlookers and the media will think there are Trump supporters rioting so it’s harder to turn popular opinion against us! We found no evidence that this meme was connected to any actual antifa groups. We should note that “antifa”— short for anti-fascist — is not a single group, but a very broad term referring to an amorphous coalition of leftist activist organizations that often act on their own initiative and don't have any centralized organizing body.
		

Is there credible evidence from reliable sources that Antifa was actively recruiting individuals to dress as President Trump supporters and police to riot on Election Day 2020 in the United States?		
Research from the University of Washington indicates that this disparity stems from political orientation and biased media framing (Washington Post, 24 August 2020), such as disproportionate coverage of violent demonstrations (Business Insider, 11 June 2020; Poynter, 25 June 2020). Groups like the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) have documented organized disinformation campaigns aimed at spreading a “deliberate mischaracterization of groups or movements [involved in the protests], such as portraying activists who support Black Lives Matter as violent extremists or claiming that antifa is a terrorist organization coordinated or manipulated by nebulous external forces” (ADL, 2020). These disinformation campaigns may be contributing to the decline in public support for the BLM movement after the initial increase following Floyd’s killing, especially amongst the white population (USA Today, 31 August 2020; Civiqs, 30 August 2020a, 30 August 2020b). This waning support also comes as the Trump administration recently shifted its “law and order” messaging to target local Democratic Party politicians from urban areas, particularly on the campaign trail (NPR, 27 August 2020).
		

Is there credible evidence from reliable sources that Antifa was actively recruiting individuals to dress as President Trump supporters and police to riot on Election Day 2020 in the United States?		
Trump tweeted last Sunday that he planned to designate antifa as a terrorist organization. “These are acts of domestic terror,” Trump said in a Rose Garden speech Monday, moments before heavily armed troops and riot police advanced without warning on the largely peaceful protesters across the street from the White House. Barr, put in charge of organizing the police and military response, activated the FBI’s Joint Terrorism Task Force last weekend to target protest organizers. “The violence instigated and carried out by Antifa and other similar groups in connection with the rioting is domestic terrorism and will be treated accordingly,” Barr said in a statement issued Sunday.

They often denounce capitalism and government. Since Trump entered the world stage, they’ve condemned his push to tighten immigration rules and what some view as his tendency toward racism. While Antifa members don’t fit a single category, they say many are millennials and many live on society’s fringes: undocumented immigrants, transgender people, low-wage workers, those who don’t conform to the traditional 9-to-5. And their methods are often violent. Antifa leaders admit they’re willing to physically attack anyone who employs violence against them or who condones racism – as long as force is used in the name of eradicating hatred. Anti-fascists and the black bloc tactic originated in Nazi Germany and resurfaced in United Kingdom in the 1980s.

Back in 2017, pro-Trump blog The Gateway Pundit ran a headline stating “Millions of Antifa Supersoldiers Will Behead White Parents” on that day. Conspiracy theorist Alex Jones also claimed antifa activists would be handing out AK-47s on Nov. 4. Snopes investigated similar claims in 2017 that argued law enforcement agents had announced that “antifa” was planning “extended violent unrest or civil war” beginning on Nov. 4. @AntifaChecker, a Twitter account devoted to sniffing out phony ""antifa"" accounts, indicated it was not aware of the 2017 call to action:
		

Is there credible evidence from reliable sources that Antifa was actively recruiting individuals to dress as President Trump supporters and police to riot on Election Day 2020 in the United States?		
Richard is right to call out the author’s obvious bias The violence is coming from neither the left or right, it’s coming from both. Antifa is not the threat as Trump states. Unless you’ve been living under a rock, Trump lies about nearly everything. The majority of violence is coming from White Supremacists & diehard Trump cultists such as the Proud Biys & boogaloo. Thank you for the balanced view on political violence by also mentioning a Bernie Sanders supporter who shot at the Republican baseball team and the repeatedly shown violence by groups like ANTIFA.
		

Is there credible evidence from reliable sources that Antifa was actively recruiting individuals to dress as President Trump supporters and police to riot on Election Day 2020 in the United States?		
The flyer has circulated online before in 2017 and 2019, as well as in 2020. Conspiracy theories about anti-fascist groups rioting on Nov. 4 are common, especially across the conservative parts of the internet. However, the 2020 screenshot of the flyer was unique because it was attached to a post referencing the Nov. 3 presidential election, adding fuel to rumors that something could be afoot in the near future. Will Sommer, a politics reporter who also focuses on conservative media, investigated the origins of Nov. 4/antifa conspiracy theories and this meme in a 2017 Medium post. He pointed out how the above-displayed flyer was part of many ""fabricated 'planning documents'"" shared on Facebook that urge antifa movements to commit violence.
		

Is there credible evidence from reliable sources that Antifa was actively recruiting individuals to dress as President Trump supporters and police to riot on Election Day 2020 in the United States?		
But Trump supporters and white nationalists see antifa’s attacks as an assault on their right to freely assemble, which they in turn seek to reassert. The result is a level of sustained political street warfare not seen in the U.S. since the 1960s. A few weeks after the attacks in San Jose, for instance, a white-supremacist leader announced that he would host a march in Sacramento to protest the attacks at Trump rallies. Anti-Fascist Action Sacramento called for a counterdemonstration; in the end, at least 10 people were stabbed. A similar cycle has played out at UC Berkeley. In February, masked antifascists broke store windows and hurled Molotov cocktails and rocks at police during a rally against the planned speech by Yiannopoulos.

What specific policies or regulations in the UK currently govern the administration of vaccines by non-medical staff, and have any recent changes or exceptions been made to allow non-medical staff to administer unlicensed vaccines?		
‘Unlicensed’ does not mean ‘untested’: this temporary authorisation process exists to address the possibility that, in certain situations of public health need, the licensing authority may consider that the balance of risk and benefit to patients justifies the temporary supply of the relevant vaccine pending the issue of a product licence. Regulation 345 of the Human Medicine Regulations transposes into UK law a requirement of EU law that key actors in the medicines supply chain cannot generally be sued in the civil courts for the consequences resulting from the use of an unlicensed product, or a new use of a licensed product, that a national licensing authority is recommending in order to deal with certain specific health threats.

What specific policies or regulations in the UK currently govern the administration of vaccines by non-medical staff, and have any recent changes or exceptions been made to allow non-medical staff to administer unlicensed vaccines?		
From January 2021, the UK’s licensing authority will have new powers to license all medicines, including vaccines. However, if there is a compelling case, on public health grounds, for using a vaccine before it is given a product licence, given the nature of the threat we face, the JCVI may take the very unusual step of advising the UK government to use a tested, unlicensed vaccine against COVID-19, and we need to make sure that the right legislative measures are in place to deal with that scenario. A temporary authorisation of the supply of an unlicensed vaccine could be given by the UK’s licensing authority under regulation 174 of the Human Medicines Regulations (see below). A COVID-19 vaccine would only be authorised in this way if the UK’s licensing authority was satisfied that there is sufficient evidence to demonstrate the safety, quality and efficacy of the vaccine.
		

What specific policies or regulations in the UK currently govern the administration of vaccines by non-medical staff, and have any recent changes or exceptions been made to allow non-medical staff to administer unlicensed vaccines?		
Expand the workforce legally allowed to administer vaccines under NHS and local authority occupational health schemes, so that additional healthcare professionals in the occupational health workforce will be able to administer vaccines. Vaccinations for health and care workers are often administered through occupational health schemes, but only nurses are authorised to administer prescription-only medicines under written instruction of a doctor. The proposals would expand the workforce that can administer COVID-19 and flu vaccinations under an NHS or local authority occupational health scheme so that it also includes midwives, nursing associates, operating department practitioners, paramedics, physiotherapists and pharmacists. This will help ensure we have the workforce needed to deliver a mass COVID-19 vaccination programme, in addition to delivery of an upscaled influenza programme, in the autumn.
		

What specific policies or regulations in the UK currently govern the administration of vaccines by non-medical staff, and have any recent changes or exceptions been made to allow non-medical staff to administer unlicensed vaccines?		
Introduce a new type of national protocol, to be authorised by UK ministers and the devolved administrations, which will allow those who are registered healthcare professionals who do not normally vaccinate, and people who are not registered healthcare professionals, to safely administer a licensed or temporarily authorised COVID-19 or influenza vaccine. This protocol would be written similarly to a PGD and would provide the flexibility to define the training and competence requirements of vaccinators, and the clinical considerations they must follow. This will ensure that all measures will be taken to ensure patient safety, including but not limited to clinical treatment of any potential reaction to the administered vaccine, such as anaphylactic shock. The use of the protocol provision will be reviewed after a year, and a report published of the review.
		

What specific policies or regulations in the UK currently govern the administration of vaccines by non-medical staff, and have any recent changes or exceptions been made to allow non-medical staff to administer unlicensed vaccines?		
The UK government is not seeking to change the current balance between what are treated as NHS issues and what are treated as regulatory issues, but to go with the grain of the existing system. 1. Temporary authorisation of the supply of unlicensed products Development of safe and effective vaccines to minimise the impact of ongoing infections during the COVID-19 pandemic remains one of the best options to protect lives. The preferred route to enable deployment of a new vaccine for COVID-19 is through the usual marketing authorisation routes.
		

What specific policies or regulations in the UK currently govern the administration of vaccines by non-medical staff, and have any recent changes or exceptions been made to allow non-medical staff to administer unlicensed vaccines?		
Currently, the HMRs require that only ‘appropriate practitioners’ administer vaccines, as they are a parenterally administered (for example by injection) prescription-only medicine. Appropriate practitioners are defined under regulation 214 as doctors and other qualified prescribers. An expanded workforce is required to ensure that the COVID-19 vaccine can be safely deployed widely as soon as it should become available, given the capacity constraints of the current workforce that can administer vaccines. Furthermore, an expanded workforce eligible for administering the flu vaccine may be required, given the recent announcement of an expanded flu vaccination programme this winter.
		

What specific policies or regulations in the UK currently govern the administration of vaccines by non-medical staff, and have any recent changes or exceptions been made to allow non-medical staff to administer unlicensed vaccines?		
These amendments on the easement of advertising restrictions are not limited to unlicensed vaccines only, but are intended to apply to all the public health purposes that would justify temporary authorisation of the distribution of an unlicensed vaccine or other treatment listed in regulation 174. This means that, in relation to medicines advertising, the permitted campaigns could relate to any medicinal product use in response to “…the suspected or confirmed spread of… pathogenic agents… toxins… chemical agents or…nuclear radiation…”. A number of changes have also been made to the special requirements for advertisements wholly or mainly directed at qualified prescribers. These have also been adapted to take into account the new arrangements for temporary authorisations.
		

What specific policies or regulations in the UK currently govern the administration of vaccines by non-medical staff, and have any recent changes or exceptions been made to allow non-medical staff to administer unlicensed vaccines?		
A COVID-19 vaccine would only be authorised in this way if the licensing authority was satisfied that there was sufficient evidence to demonstrate the safety, quality and efficacy of the vaccine, in the particular context in which the licensing authority was asked to take that decision. At no point does the product itself become ‘authorised’ in the sense of ‘licensed’ – it remains unlicensed. However, we should also be clear that ‘unlicensed’ does not mean ‘untested’, and that regulation 174 exists to address the possibility that, in certain situations of public health need, the licensing authority may consider that the balance of risk and benefit to patients justifies authorising temporary supply of a medicine such as a COVID-19 vaccine pending the issue of a product licence. The language of regulation 174 makes clear that the powers are available where there is a suspected or actual spread of pathogens, which would include, but would not be confined to, a pandemic.
		

What specific policies or regulations in the UK currently govern the administration of vaccines by non-medical staff, and have any recent changes or exceptions been made to allow non-medical staff to administer unlicensed vaccines?		
Regulation 174 is an implementing measure for Article 5(2) of the EU Medicines Directive 2001/83, representing the UK’s choice of form and methods for doing so in 2012. If the need arises, regulation 174, in its present form, could be used to authorise nationwide distribution and supply of an unlicensed COVID-19 vaccine (or treatment) in the UK, as well as other potential products. In practice, this means that, if a suitable COVID-19 vaccine candidate – with strong supporting evidence of safety, quality and efficacy – became available before the end of the transition period but it had not yet been licensed by the European Medicines Agency, regulation 174 could be used to enable temporary UK-only deployment. For these purposes, it makes no difference whether the vaccine had been developed in the UK, elsewhere in the EU/EEA or completely outside UK/EEA.

He called it N1H1; it's actually H1N1. You know, you remember the ""H"" comes before the ""N,"" so it's sort of easy to remember, right? But Joe always calls it the opposite way, but it was—call it the ""swine flu."" It was disastrous. And his own Chief of Staff said that when Biden helped manage the swine flu in 2009, they, quote, ""did everything possible wrong."" And 60 million Americans got H1N1 in that period of time.

And, Biden's top advisor at the time has acknowledged that the Obama administration didn't do ""anything right"" to combat that pandemic, before walking back those comments. The record seemingly complicates Biden's claims, in advertising and speeches, that he would have handled state-level coronavirus testing more effectively than the current White House. ""In late July, the CDC abruptly advised states to stop testing for H1N1 flu, and stopped counting individual cases,"" CBS News reported in 2009. ""The rationale given for the CDC guidance to forego testing and tracking individual cases was: why waste resources testing for H1N1 flu when the government has already confirmed there's an epidemic?""
		

Who is the chief of staff referenced in the claim, and can you provide a verified source or direct quote confirming that they made this statement about Joe Biden's management of the swine flu in 2009?		
It had nothing to do with us doing anything right. It just had to do with luck. If anyone thinks that this can’t happen again, they don’t have to go back to 1918, they just have to go back to 2009, 2010 and imagine a virus with a different lethality, and you can just do the math on that.” POLITICO: BIDEN FOUGHT A PANDEMIC BEFORE. IT DIDN'T GO WELL Klain has since backtracked, claiming he was only talking about vaccine difficulties. Some of Biden's other attacks on the president's coronavirus efforts have also been seemingly undercut in recent months.

Now, they did say it would be based on the recommendation of the experts, but you know, whether expert or not, we're not doing any more shutdowns. We did the shutdown, and now we're doing the opening, and there won't be any more shutdowns. There could be a little section, a small section, where you have a breakout, but we're not talking about shutdowns like they were talking about, depending on experts. The swine flu was a disaster, you remember, when—not nearly as deadly, not—not the same world. But when Joe Biden was Vice President, his failed approach to the swine flu was disastrous.
		

Who is the chief of staff referenced in the claim, and can you provide a verified source or direct quote confirming that they made this statement about Joe Biden's management of the swine flu in 2009?		
According to the CDC, ""as 2009 H1N1 cases continued to occur through the spring and summer, the task of counting cases became increasingly difficult. On May 12, 2009, CDC transitioned from reporting individual confirmed and probable cases of 2009 H1N1 influenza to reporting aggregate counts of 2009 H1N1 lab confirmed and probable cases, hospitalizations and deaths with the launch of an aggregate reporting web site. Once the numbers of cases increased beyond the point where counting of individual cases was practical, on July 23, 2009, CDC reported the number of 2009 cases for the last time."" Ron Klain, who served as Biden's chief of staff in 2009 and currently advises him on health matters, remarked last year: “It is purely a fortuity that this isn’t one of the great mass casualty events in American history.

By 2016, the final year of the Obama administration, much had been learned from swine flu about managing a pandemic, and more knowledge had been added from the responses to the 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa. From October 2014 through February 2015, Ron Klain, a former chief of staff to Vice President Joe Biden, was the White House Ebola response coordinator. From this experience, Klain concluded that a director with singular focus was needed for a pandemic. “The next president should put a coordinating unit together before an outbreak begins,” he argued in his essay “Confronting the Pandemic Threat” in the spring 2016 Democracy Journal. Klain called for a pandemic prevention directorate to make sure preparation and response are a priority from day one in a new administration and to oversee the government’s response to a pandemic.

Reporter Sharyl Attkisson continued: ""Some public health officials privately disagreed with the decision to stop testing and counting, telling CBS News that continued tracking of this new and possibly changing virus was important because H1N1 has a different epidemiology, affects younger people more than seasonal flu and has been shown to have a higher case fatality rate than other flu virus strains."" CORONAVIRUS TIMELINE SHOWS DEMS', MEDIA'S CHANGING RHETORIC ON THE PANDEMIC CBS News reported that the decision to ""stop counting H1N1 flu cases was made so hastily that states weren't given the opportunity to provide input."" The Biden campaign did not immediately respond to an after-hours email from Fox News seeking comment.

At one point, in June 2009, Obama invited experts who helped respond to the 1976 swine flu outbreak to a private meeting at the White House. He wanted to know “what went right and what went wrong. What do we need to learn, how do we need to do this,” Sebelius said. “I haven’t seen any of that go on with this,” she added, referring to the coronavirus.

“I guarantee you we did,” Whittaker replied. Exhibits A and B were episodes broadcast in 2009 (“H1N1”) and 2005, a segment called “Chasing the Flu.” Alarmed by an advance copy of John Barry’s book The Great Influenza, then President George W. Bush gave a speech on November 1, 2005, at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) on plans to prevent a pandemic. The plan included detecting outbreaks around the world, stockpiling vaccines and drugs, and improving vaccine production capacity. “A pandemic can continue spreading destruction in repeated ways that can last for a year or more,” Bush said.

Richard is right to call out the author’s obvious bias The violence is coming from neither the left or right, it’s coming from both. Antifa is not the threat as Trump states. Unless you’ve been living under a rock, Trump lies about nearly everything. The majority of violence is coming from White Supremacists & diehard Trump cultists such as the Proud Biys & boogaloo.

Has there been any credible, verified report or official statement from Antifa or any affiliated group admitting to deliberately igniting fires to draw attention to climate change?		
There is not a whisper of the widespread, systematic violence by ANTIFA (which is NOT uniformly condemned by Democrats). Perhaps ANTIFA’s activities are not “ominous” enough (to borrow Prof. Sibler’s descriptive) to warrant attention, although I am sure journalist Andy Ngo disagrees. This is propaganda. Granted, it is well-done propaganda, but propaganda nonetheless. Here’s how it works: (1) pick your interviewee carefully. He or she should be sophisticated, credentialed, articulate and most importantly biased, but not obviously so; (2) don’t lie, but leave out important – indeed indispensable – truths (how can one NOT mention ANTIFA in an article like this?); (3) do not present the opposing view, or if you do use a hostile interviewer and choose the stupidest or most-tepid advocate of the opposing position you can find; and (4) overtly advance an accurate but uncontroversial idea (i.e. the current political climate is worrisome), while subtly slipping in the point you are really trying to advance (republicans are stupid, evil and murderous).
		

Has there been any credible, verified report or official statement from Antifa or any affiliated group admitting to deliberately igniting fires to draw attention to climate change?		
Research from the University of Washington indicates that this disparity stems from political orientation and biased media framing (Washington Post, 24 August 2020), such as disproportionate coverage of violent demonstrations (Business Insider, 11 June 2020; Poynter, 25 June 2020). Groups like the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) have documented organized disinformation campaigns aimed at spreading a “deliberate mischaracterization of groups or movements [involved in the protests], such as portraying activists who support Black Lives Matter as violent extremists or claiming that antifa is a terrorist organization coordinated or manipulated by nebulous external forces” (ADL, 2020). These disinformation campaigns may be contributing to the decline in public support for the BLM movement after the initial increase following Floyd’s killing, especially amongst the white population (USA Today, 31 August 2020; Civiqs, 30 August 2020a, 30 August 2020b). This waning support also comes as the Trump administration recently shifted its “law and order” messaging to target local Democratic Party politicians from urban areas, particularly on the campaign trail (NPR, 27 August 2020).

366,Biden called law enforcement the enemy.,"Can you provide the specific date, location, and context in which President Biden allegedly made this statement, and verify if it was recorded or reported by credible sources?		
White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany tweeted Thursday, “Joe Biden says police have ‘become the ENEMY.’ How disgusting & sad!” The Trump campaign and Donald Trump Jr. also highlighted the “enemy” quote. Facts First: Biden was speaking specifically about residents’ perceptions of police who enter communities in armored military vehicles – saying that this looks like “the military invading” and makes police “become the enemy.” “Vice President Biden has spoken out for years against providing police with equipment that only belongs in war zones, and was highlighting that doing so has the potential to worsen divides between the public servants who put their lives on the line to keep us all safe and the people they serve,” said Biden spokesman Andrew Bates, adding that Biden’s emphasis on improving these relations is why he has long advocated investment in community policing.
		

Can you provide the specific date, location, and context in which President Biden allegedly made this statement, and verify if it was recorded or reported by credible sources?		
“Surplus military equipment for law enforcement — they don’t need that,” he said. ”The last thing you need is an up-armored Humvee coming into a neighborhood; it’s like the military invading. They don’t know anybody; they become the enemy. They’re supposed to be protecting these people.” Biden said police “become the enemy” when they use military equipment in a way that’s like invading a neighborhood. » READ MORE: Read more: Pence takes Biden’s comments on police funding, ‘enemy’ out of context
		

Can you provide the specific date, location, and context in which President Biden allegedly made this statement, and verify if it was recorded or reported by credible sources?		
That statement followed a video interview Biden did with liberal activist Ady Barkan that posted July 8. Barkan spent most of the 27-minute interview asking about health care. But about 20 minutes in, the discussion turned to George Floyd and Breonna Taylor, both unarmed Black people killed in encounters with police. Biden spoke about his interest in redirecting some law enforcement funding to social services, mental health counseling, and affordable housing. Then he spoke about police using military equipment in their communities, which is where the “enemy” comment came up.
		

Can you provide the specific date, location, and context in which President Biden allegedly made this statement, and verify if it was recorded or reported by credible sources?		
They don’t know anybody, they become the enemy; they’re supposed to be protecting these people,” he said. Clearly, the “enemy” comment was not some sort of general assessment of police officers or even a statement about how police officers are generally seen by communities. It was specifically about perceptions of police who use particular equipment in particular circumstances. Also, when Pence claimed Biden said “well-armed” police become the enemy, he may have created the impression that Biden said that police become the enemy when they carry powerful guns.
		

Can you provide the specific date, location, and context in which President Biden allegedly made this statement, and verify if it was recorded or reported by credible sources?		
Biden continued by calling for the series of changes we outlined in our above fact check on the “enemy” remark, including a focus on community policing and more investigations of police departments. After Biden criticized the police use of military vehicles, Barkan interjected, “But do we agree that we can redirect some of the funding?” The video omits the comments Biden made immediately after that. But those comments are important. After his “absolutely,” Biden immediately returned to his previous proposal about putting conditions on federal funding to police funding.
		

Can you provide the specific date, location, and context in which President Biden allegedly made this statement, and verify if it was recorded or reported by credible sources?		
In both cases, though, the attacks left out critical context. In the second case, about Biden’s views on police funding, the attacks were aided by the fact that an edited video of the conversation published by a progressive entity, NowThis News, left out some key words from the former vice president. Vice President Mike Pence claimed in a tweet on Thursday night that Biden “referred to the police (as) ‘the enemy.’” At a police union rally in Pennsylvania earlier in the day, Pence made a slightly longer accusation: “I heard that, just yesterday, Joe Biden said that well-armed police, in his words, ‘become the enemy.’”
		

Can you provide the specific date, location, and context in which President Biden allegedly made this statement, and verify if it was recorded or reported by credible sources?		
But the context the Trump allies haven’t highlighted – some of which was missing from the video – casts Biden’s words in a different light. Facts First: Biden explicitly told Barkan that he opposes defunding or abolishing the police; this comment was omitted from the video. Biden did say he “absolutely” agrees that some funding can be redirected, but it was not exactly clear what he meant – and he immediately transitioned to his previous proposal to deny federal funding to specific police departments that do not meet certain standards. Contrary to suggestions of a recent flip-flop, Biden said in early June that it makes sense for some local communities to reduce police funding.

So Pence used his speech in a steamy strip mall parking lot in Greensburg to attack Biden’s record on key issues in the battleground state. He repeated several of the Trump campaign’s criticisms of Biden: that he doesn’t support the police, that he wants to ban fracking, and that major American cities like Philadelphia wouldn’t be safe on his watch. We’ve scrutinized these claims before, and we’re summarizing what we know below. Pence claimed Biden had called police “the enemy” during a similar event with police officers and their supporters earlier this month at Fraternal Order of Police Lodge 5 in Northeast Philadelphia.
		

Can you provide the specific date, location, and context in which President Biden allegedly made this statement, and verify if it was recorded or reported by credible sources?		
Biden spoke to Barkan about how to improve policing. He called for a focus on community policing – those comments did not appear in the video – and for federal “pattern or practice” investigations into troubled police departments. He also criticized no-knock warrants for drug cases. And Biden said the federal government should have access to records about officers’ misconduct. Then he touted the Obama-Biden administration’s efforts to reduce the transfer of surplus military equipment to local police departments. “Surplus military equipment for law enforcement: they don’t need that. The last thing you need is an up-armored Humvee coming into a neighborhood; it’s like the military invading.

Biden's campaign has said he does not support defunding the police. But in a Now This interview with activist Ady Barkan, the presumptive Democratic nominee said that police forces don’t need surplus military equipment, saying this is what leads them to “become the enemy” in a community. “But do we agree that we can redirect some of the [police] funding?” Barkan asked Biden. “Yes, absolutely,” said the former vice president.

Cloth masks will not protect you from wildfire smoke. Cloth masks that are used to slow the spread of COVID-19 by blocking respiratory droplets offer little protection against wildfire smoke. They do not catch small, harmful particles in smoke that can harm your health. Although N95 respirators do provide protection from wildfire smoke, they might be in short supply as frontline healthcare workers use them during the pandemic.
		

Do the CDC guidelines specify that ordinary (non-N95) masks are ineffective against wildfire smoke due to their inability to filter small particles?		
- Cloth masks with filters inserted or sewn into them should not be relied upon to protect against wildfire smoke exposure because the level of protection that they provide against particulate air pollutants is highly dependent on the fit of the mask and the characteristics of the filter. CDC resources about personal protective equipment, NIOSH-approved particle-filtering respirators, optimizing the supply of N95 respirators, and alternatives to N95 respirators [PDF-220 KB] provide additional information about the use of particle-filtering respirators. The following resources provide information for public health officials and the public about reducing wildfire smoke concentrations and improving air quality in homes and other indoor spaces during wildfire smoke events:
		

Do the CDC guidelines specify that ordinary (non-N95) masks are ineffective against wildfire smoke due to their inability to filter small particles?		
Other tips to protect your health during wildfire smoke events If you must spend time outdoors, a well-fitted respirator type mask (such as a NIOSH certified N95 or equivalent respirator) that does not allow air to pass through small openings between the mask and face, can help reduce your exposure to the fine particles in smoke. These fine particles generally pose the greatest risk to health. However, respirators do not reduce exposure to the gases in wildfire smoke. It is important to listen to your body and reduce or stop activities if you are experiencing symptoms.
		

Do the CDC guidelines specify that ordinary (non-N95) masks are ineffective against wildfire smoke due to their inability to filter small particles?		
While a face mask can help protect you from this smoke, the cloth masks many people have been wearing as a precaution against COVID-19 probably won't get the job done, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). ""Cloth masks that are used to slow the spread of COVID-19 by blocking respiratory droplets offer little protection against wildfire smoke,"" the CDC states on a new section of its website dedicated to wildfires and COVID-19. ""They do not catch small, harmful particles in smoke that can harm your health."" While respirator-style masks are the most protective against smoke, there are other ways to protect yourself if you don't have one. The Best Face Masks to Protect Against Wildfire Smoke The CDC specifically says that N95 respirators provide protection from wildfire smoke, but adds that “they might be in short supply as frontline healthcare workers use them during the pandemic.”
		

Do the CDC guidelines specify that ordinary (non-N95) masks are ineffective against wildfire smoke due to their inability to filter small particles?		
Smoke particulate averages about 0.3 microns, so these masks will filter out a significant portion of the smoke if they are properly fit to the wearer’s face. These masks, which may include an exhale valve, do not require cartridge filters. They are marked with one of the following: “R95”, “N95”, or “P95.” Soft masks with higher ratings (R, N or P 99 and R, N, or P 100) are also available and will filter out even more particulates. There are several drawbacks to recommending widespread mask use in an area affected by wildfire smoke.

Not the dust mask that Lewsadder was wearing. Or the surgical masks that loop around your ears. Forget wearing a bandana or holding a tissue over your mouth — those won’t protect your lungs. The California Governor’s Office of Emergency Services and the California Department of Public Health recommend “N95” respirators or “P100” masks, both of which are approved by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health for health care workers and firefighters. Those simple-but-sophisticated masks are intended to block at least 95 percent of the hazardous and tiny particulate matter — known as PM2.5 — that spews from wildfire smoke. At 2.5 microns or less in diameter, the particles of PM2.5 can’t even be seen by the naked eye, said Dr. John Balmes, a professor of environmental health sciences at the University of California-Berkeley.

Though the percentage increased since then, the current lot of DM or SP are not from those who became IAS or IPS during the last three years,” he said adding that the current situation is not bad in Bihar. Dr Mahmood, a former IRS (Indian Revenue Service), says the situation in UP is indeed bad. “The representation of Muslims as DM or SP is very bad in UP. It is true that the percentage of Muslim IAS/IPS is low but not even that percentage is visible on these posts,” he said.

Talking to this reporter, former civil servant Dr Syed Zafar Mahmood says the negligible presence of Muslim DM or SP is because of low presence of Muslims among the ranks of IAS and IPS officers. “Bihar’s figure (4 Muslims among 76 DMs/SPs) stands at around 5% while UP’s is even poorer – less than 1%. The overall all-India percentage of Muslims among IAS and IPS was restricted at 2.5% till 2016. But the results of civil services exams in the next three years (2017, 2018, 2019) took the percentage to around 5% thanks to the efforts made between 2009-2016 (by community-run civil services coaching centres). The present low representation of Muslim officers as DM or SP is because their percentage among IAS and IPS was just around 2.5% till 2016.

When asked about her opinion on why there is less number of female Muslim candidates as opposed to male Muslim candidates, she replied: “Muslim female candidates are less in number because often times they do not always get the support they need from society and family; they definitely need to be encouraged and supported more.” Acording to IAS coaching academices, there has been notable increase in numbers of Muslim candidates appearing for civil services and attending coaching centres in the last few years.

Apart from Jamia Millia Islamia, the coaching centres were set up at Jamia Hamdard University, Delhi, Aligarh Muslim University, Maulana Azad National Urdu University, Hyderabad, and Bhimrao Ambedkar University, Delhi. The initial grant for setting up the centres was given by the UGC, and the central government now issues funds annually for their operations. According to Prakash, most of the universities, “especially Jamia Hamdard and Jamia Millia”, are doing a very good job, and “producing a good number of civil servants each year”.

Mohammad Tarique, deputy director at the centre, said, “Ever since the inception of the coaching centre in 2010, we have had more than 240 students selected and placed as IAS, IPS, IRS and customs officers. More than 260 students have been placed as officers in the state services, and central armed police forces, like the BSF, ITBP and others.” Former University Grants Commission (UGC) chairman Ved Prakash, under whom the five coaching centres were established, said the initiative was aimed at increasing the representation of people from backward castes and minorities in civil services. “It was felt that minorities and people from the SC, ST communities are not fairly represented in civil services, hence the coaching centres were started in five universities,” Prakash said.

The facility is one of five centres set up by the government between 2009 and 2010 to provide underprivileged communities with free residential coaching for the civil services and other government exams. As IPS officer Sagar said, it is a place where underprivileged communities — not just Muslims, but also the Scheduled Tribes (STs), the Scheduled Castes (SCs) and women — find a fighting shot at a dream that is, by far, the most coveted accomplishment for most Indians. The initiative is meant to encourage more students from these communities to ace government exams. And student experiences suggest it is helping them do exactly that.

Overall, notes Jones, of Harvard, “The risks of vaccines are lower now than in the past because production is much better than it used to be.” Efforts are underway to accelerate the process to fight COVID-19. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) launched a Phase I trial on March 16 with 45 human volunteers using a messenger RNA vaccine that did not go through a full round of animal testing first. The NIH said scientists “were able to quickly develop” the vaccine by adapting ongoing research into a vaccine for “related coronaviruses” that had been subject to animal testing.
		

When and why were the clinical trials of the COVID-19 vaccine paused?		
Fauci says coronavirus vaccine trials could be stopped early if they produce good results Washington — Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's leading infectious disease expert, said clinical trials on a coronavirus vaccine could be stopped early if they provide positive results that show it is safe and effective. In an interview with Kaiser Health News published Tuesday, Fauci, the head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said a Data and Safety Monitoring Board, which is composed of research experts that review data from clinical trials, has the power to end the trials early. The independent board, Fauci said, could decide ""the data is so good right now that you can say it's safe and effective.""
		

When and why were the clinical trials of the COVID-19 vaccine paused?		
As part of the ongoing randomised, controlled clinical trials of the AstraZeneca Oxford coronavirus vaccine, AZD1222, a standard review process has been triggered, leading to the voluntary pause of vaccination across all trials to allow an independent committee to review the safety data of a single event of an unexplained illness that occurred in the UK Phase III trial. This is a routine action which has to happen whenever there is a potentially unexplained illness in one of the trials, while it is investigated, ensuring we maintain the integrity of the trials. In large clinical trials, illnesses will happen by chance and must be independently reviewed. AstraZeneca is working to expedite the review of the single event to minimise any potential impact on the trial timeline. We are committed to the safety of our participants and the highest standards of conduct in our trials.

“Vaccine development is a tough space to be in because the risk is high, the timelines are long, and it’s expensive,” says Peter Hotez, MD, dean of Baylor’s National School of Tropical Medicine, who oversees a COVID-19 vaccine project there. What’s more, private and government labs throughout the United States and in other countries are moving on vaccine development as well — and ultimately, only a few are likely to get through the tests and make it to market. China’s Academy of Military Medical Sciences reports that it started recruiting volunteers for a clinical trial of a vaccine. German companies BioNTech (partnering with Pfizer) and CureVac say they plan to start clinical trials as soon as this month.
		

When and why were the clinical trials of the COVID-19 vaccine paused?		
Despite some early studies raising hopes that the drug could be used to cure coronavirus, one subsequent larger scale trial has shown it is not effective as a treatment. The World Health Organization (WHO) has halted its trials, saying it doesn't reduce death rates in patients with coronavirus. Last month, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) cautioned against using the drug to treat coronavirus patients, following reports of ""serious heart rhythm problems"" and other health issues. And Dr Anthony Fauci, a leading member of the White House coronavirus task force, has reiterated these views.
		

When and why were the clinical trials of the COVID-19 vaccine paused?		
If the clinical trials were to produce results that are overwhelmingly positive, scientists would have a ""moral obligation"" to stop the trial early and make the vaccine available to all participants in the study, speeding up the process to make it more widely available. ""If you are making a decision about the vaccine, you'd better be sure you have very good evidence that it is both safe and effective,"" Fauci said. He added that he is ""not concerned about political pressure."" The Trump administration has set a goal to deliver 300 million doses of a coronavirus vaccine by January through its initiative Operation Warp Speed.
		

When and why were the clinical trials of the COVID-19 vaccine paused?		
Researchers at UW, Mayo Clinic, Duke University School of Medicine, and Baylor College of Medicine, among others, tapped into past and ongoing projects to focus on stopping the virus that causes COVID-19. At Mayo, Poland echoes the thinking of other lab leaders when he says, “We have technology and expertise. For academic medical labs with the foundational research, scientific tools, and human expertise, producing a vaccine to test can take just months. Several reported in late March that they were preparing to test vaccines on animals or humans. That’s where the process slows to a degree that surprises outsiders.

When and why were the clinical trials of the COVID-19 vaccine paused?		
Phase 3 vaccine trials are currently underway in three of six vaccine candidates backed by the project. While President Trump has touted the administration's work in supporting the development of a coronavirus vaccine and other therapeutics, there have been rising concerns that some of the nation's public health agencies overseeing the coronavirus response are facing heightened political pressure from the White House. Last month, Mr. Trump suggested in a radio interview a coronavirus vaccine could be ready before November 3, Election Day. He has also claimed without evidence that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is slow-walking testing on vaccines and therapeutics to harm his reelection prospects.

Catastrophic wildfires in Oregon, Washington, and California in early September 2020 have, as of this writing, killed seven people, forced thousands to evacuate, burned homes, and scorched millions of acres. Amid this chaos and destruction, emergency responders were forced to take time to counter misinformation galloping across social media platforms — rumors that falsely claimed political extremists were behind a coordinated arson campaign.

The fact of the matter is that it’s a fabricated story which was propagated by Ujjwal Nikam, the public prosecutor of the 26/11 trial. During the trial, Nikam, who had argued on behalf of the state, had manufactured a story about Ajmal Kasab being fed biryani in jail to counter an emotional wave supposedly being created in Kasab’s favour.
		

Was there any credible evidence or official report that specifically states that Kasab was fed biriyani during his detention or trial?		
Later the doctors who treated him also identified him. On 2 June 2009, Kasab told the judge he also understood the Marathi language.[90] In June 2009, the special court issued non-bailable warrants against 22 absconding accused including Jamaat-ud-Dawa (JuD) chief Hafeez Saeed and chief of operations of Lashkar-e-Taiba, Zaki-ur-Rehman Laqvi.[90] On 20 July 2009, Kasab retracted his non-guilty plea and pleaded guilty to all charges.[96] On 18 December 2009, he retracted his guilty plea and claimed that he was framed and his confession was obtained by torture. Instead he claimed to have come to Mumbai 20 days before the attacks and was simply strolling at Juhu beach when police arrested him.[97]
		

Was there any credible evidence or official report that specifically states that Kasab was fed biriyani during his detention or trial?		
He asked the Pakistani High Commission to take custody of the body of fellow terrorist Ismail Khan.[88] Pakistani officials confirmed the receipt of the letter and were reported to be studying it. On 1 April 2009, senior Indian advocate Anjali Waghmare agreed to represent Kasab, despite Shiv Sena activists having protested and stoned her home.[89] His conviction was based on CCTV footage showing him striding across the Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus with an AK-47 and a backpack. Towards the end of December 2008, Ujjwal Nikam was appointed as Public Prosecutor for trying Kasab and in January 2009, M. L. Tahaliyani was appointed the judge for the case.[90] Indian investigators filed an 11,000-page Chargesheet against Kasab on 25 February 2009.[91]
		

Was there any credible evidence or official report that specifically states that Kasab was fed biriyani during his detention or trial?		
Due to the fact that the chargesheet was written in Marathi and English, Kasab requested an Urdu translation of the charge sheet.[92] He was charged with murder, conspiracy and waging war against India along with other crimes. His trial was originally scheduled to start on 15 April 2009 but was postponed as his lawyer, Anjali Waghmare was dismissed for a conflict of interest.[93] It resumed on 17 April 2009 after Abbas Kazmi was assigned as his new defence counsel.[94] On 20 April 2009, the prosecution submitted a list of charges against him, including the murder of 166 people.[90] On 6 May 2009, Kasab pleaded not guilty to 86 charges.[95] The same month he was identified by eyewitnesses who testified witnessing his actual arrival and him firing at the victims.

379,US Congress voted 49-46 to add the repeal of Section 230 — legislation which shields online platforms from liability for user-generated content — into the country’s annual defense bill in December 2020,"Did the US Congress vote 49-46 to include the repeal of Section 230 in the annual defense bill in December 2020?		
More recently, he threatened to veto the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), an annual defense funding bill, if it does not revoke Section 230. The impact of these moves on online expression could be profound. Section 230 was conceived in response to two court cases in the 1990s that dealt with the liability of internet companies for defamatory posts on their websites. In one case, a federal court in New York ruled that the company CompuServe was not liable because it was merely a host and did not moderate any of the content on its forums.
		

Did the US Congress vote 49-46 to include the repeal of Section 230 in the annual defense bill in December 2020?		
Going forward, Congress could move to repeal Section 230 entirely, says Jeff Kosseff, the author of The Twenty-Six Words That Created the Internet. If that happens, it’s not clear what would come next, he says; companies could move to restrict or eliminate user content to avoid liability, or stop moderating altogether. Other countries, including those in the European Union, have stricter rules for online content, leading tech companies to push to export Section 230 via U.S. trade deals. “We really just don’t know how courts would interpret the First Amendment protections without Section 230 because we haven’t really seen that applied to social media,” Kosseff said.
		

Did the US Congress vote 49-46 to include the repeal of Section 230 in the annual defense bill in December 2020?		
Though few others seem to favor a total repeal, lawmakers have expressed interest in scaling back some of the powers of Section 230 or making platforms earn its protections by complying with certain standards. ""On 230, I know there are some that have said just get rid of it,"" Rep. Jan Schakowsky, D-Ill., told CNBC in an interview in January. Shakowsky had recently hosted a hearing on deepfakes and digital deception in the consumer protection subcommittee, which she chairs. ""Our view is that we want to protect First Amendment rights, there's no question. But right now, we think the balance favors those who want a liability shield, and [it] goes way too far in that sense.""

- Amending Section 230 to require large online platforms to remove court-determined illegal content and activity within 24 hours; and - Allowing small online platforms to have more flexibility in responding to user complaints, removing illegal content, and acting on illegal activity, based on their size and capacity. - Exempting the enforcement of federal civil laws from Section 230 so that online platforms cannot use it as a defense when federal regulators, like the Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission, pursue civil actions for online activity; - Allowing state attorneys general to enforce federal civil laws against online platforms that have the same substantive elements of the laws and regulations of that state; and

Section 230 is a part of federal legislation passed more than 20 years ago. It runs only 26-words long—short and to the point. But it has had an outsize affect on life as we know it. They are the “26 words that created the Internet,” says Jeff Kosseff, a cybersecurity law professor at the U.S Naval Academy and one of the foremost experts on Section 230. Most fundamentally, Section 230 provides immunity to social media companies like Facebook and Twitter
		

Did the US Congress vote 49-46 to include the repeal of Section 230 in the annual defense bill in December 2020?		
While competition has been a core part of the Department’s review, we also recognize that not all concerns raised about online platforms (including internet-based businesses and social media platforms) fall squarely within the U.S. antitrust laws. Our review has therefore looked broadly at other legal and policy frameworks applicable to online platforms. One key part of that legal landscape is Section 230, which provides immunity to online platforms from civil liability based on third-party content as well as immunity for removal of content in certain circumstances. Drafted in the early years of internet commerce, Section 230 was enacted in response to a problem that incipient online platforms were facing.

Section by Section: An accompanying document to the redline that provides a detailed description and purpose for each edit to the existing statute. As part of its broader review of market-leading online platforms, the U.S. Department of Justice analyzed Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996, which provides immunity to online platforms from civil liability based on third-party content and for the removal of content in certain circumstances. Congress originally enacted the statute to nurture a nascent industry while also incentivizing online platforms to remove content harmful to children. The combination of significant technological changes since 1996 and the expansive interpretation that courts have given Section 230, however, has left online platforms both immune for a wide array of illicit activity on their services and free to moderate content with little transparency or accountability.
		

Did the US Congress vote 49-46 to include the repeal of Section 230 in the annual defense bill in December 2020?		
Another mistaken belief is that Section 230 has something to do with copyright. Rules on when a platform must take down content that violates copyright are not set by Section 230, but by the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. Finally, as already mentioned, Section 230 does not provide blanket immunity: it doesn’t protect websites in the case of actions that violate federal criminal law. Unfortunately, there’s no exception for state criminal law, and states are usually first to criminalize things like sex trafficking. As scrutiny of Big Tech increases, politicians—both Democrats and Republicans—are concerned with how Section 230 has shaped the internet.
		

Did the US Congress vote 49-46 to include the repeal of Section 230 in the annual defense bill in December 2020?		
Much of the modern debate over Section 230 has been at opposite ends of the spectrum. Many have called for an outright repeal of the statute in light of the changed technological landscape and growing online harms. Others, meanwhile, have insisted that Section 230 be left alone and claimed that any reform will crumble the tech industry. Based on our analysis and external engagement, the Department believes there is productive middle ground and has identified a set of measured, yet concrete proposals that address many of the concerns raised about Section 230. A reassessment of America’s laws governing the internet could not be timelier. Citizens are relying on the internet more than ever for commerce, entertainment, education, employment, and public discourse.

President Trump has threatened to veto a major defense funding bill over a law that protects social media companies from liability for what their users post. It’s been called the “twenty-six words that created the internet.” Section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act is a landmark U.S. law that shields social media companies such as Twitter and Facebook from liability for content their users post. The tech industry maintains that the provision allows the internet to flourish, but critics say companies either aren’t doing enough to combat harmful content, or are going too far with censorship. President Donald J. Trump has called to repeal the law and signed an executive order attempting to curb some of its protections, though the order has been challenged in court.

In the campaign video, Biden mostly talks about the Corvette Sting Ray and what it means to him personally, as well as the feeling he gets when driving it. However, at one point he looks to the future and says “and by the way, they tell me, and I’m looking forward, if it’s true, to driving one – that they’re making an electric Corvette that can go 200 mph.” The comment prompted GM spokesperson Jeannine Ginivan to issue their standard future product statement as shared with the Detroit Free Press:

He talks about how he’s never been as good a driver as his father, who gifted the ‘Vette to him on his wedding day, and about the feeling of pure control you get at the wheel of such a mighty machine.

As you can see at the one minute mark, Biden is talking about how electric vehicles can enable American automakers to “own the 21st century market.” He then goes on to say, “They tell me, and I’m looking forward, if it’s true to driving one, that they’re making an electric Corvette that can go 200 mph (322 km/h).” While Biden did throw out a cautionary “if it’s true,” he then says “You think I’m kidding?

Kamala Harris’s recent troubles are in fact due to her own shortcomings as a candidate and as a campaigner, nothing else. The sooner she realizes that, the sooner she can do what she needs to do and drop out and focus on her work as a senator. In my opinion, it all went downhill for her when she chose to take a cheap shot at former vice president Joe Biden in the first democratic debate. Which interestingly enough is around the same time her support began to fall. On stage, she implied that the vice president was racist and accused him of being on the wrong side of history during his career as a senator.

Brazil Accounted for a Third of the World’s Tropical Primary Forest Loss Brazil single-handedly accounted for over a third of all loss of humid tropical primary forests worldwide, with more primary forest lost than any other tropical country in 2019. Outside of 2016 and 2017, when forest fires resulted in unprecedented forest loss, 2019 was Brazil’s worst year for primary forests in 13 years.

What are the most recent and reliable statistics or comparative studies on deforestation and forest preservation efforts across various countries, including Brazil, to determine its performance relative to others?		
For the third consecutive year, Indonesia has succeeded in reducing the rate of deforestation, while in Brazil, deforestation increased considerably last year. Brazil alone accounted for one-third of global deforestation, according to GFW. The report shows that the total loss of primary forest increased by 2.8 per cent in 2019 compared to the previous year. Moreover, deforestation has huge global consequences for the climate. According to GFW, in 2019 the extent of deforestation was equivalent to the annual carbon dioxide emissions from 400 million cars.

Global Forest Watch analysis puts the loss of tree cover to a disturbance of woody vegetation over five meters in height- irrespective of mature primary forests, secondary forests recovering due to past disturbance, or tree plantations. Brazil accounted for over a third of all loss of humid tropical primary forests worldwide in comparison to other tropical nations in the year 2019. Brazilian Amazon witnessed increasing incidents of high fire, which occurred mainly on the already-deforested areas that were cleared off by farmers for agriculture and cattle rearing. Central Africa presented another disparaging state of forests as several countries in the Congo basin experienced sustained or worsening primary forest loss in 2019, which includes the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).
		

What are the most recent and reliable statistics or comparative studies on deforestation and forest preservation efforts across various countries, including Brazil, to determine its performance relative to others?		
Brazil accounted for the largest loss of primary forest, with more than 1.3 million hectares lost in 2019. Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro has faced global criticism and condemnation for the deforestation occurring under his watch. He has also been accused of incentivizing the activity of illegal ranchers, miners and loggers. Data from Brazil's National Institute for Space Research (INPE) shows the first trimester of 2020 saw a more than 50% increase in deforestation compared to last year.
		

What are the most recent and reliable statistics or comparative studies on deforestation and forest preservation efforts across various countries, including Brazil, to determine its performance relative to others?		
Forest Loss in Brazil Remained Elevated After Fire-Related Spike Brazil’s primary forest loss in 2018 was lower than its 2016-2017 fire-related spike, but still more than it was from 2007-2015, when the country had reduced its deforestation rate by 70 percent. PRODES, Brazil’s official monitoring system for the Amazon, has similarly showed an upward trend in deforestation since 2012 (read more about the difference in these two data sets here). Though some of the 2018 loss can be attributed to fire, most of it appears to be due to clear cutting in the Amazon, putting at risk the declines in deforestation the country achieved in the early 2000s.
		

What are the most recent and reliable statistics or comparative studies on deforestation and forest preservation efforts across various countries, including Brazil, to determine its performance relative to others?		
We’ll have to wait until next year’s data for more insights. Though Brazil experienced a decline in deforestation in the early 2000s, this has not been true in other parts of South America. Colombia, Bolivia and Peru all experienced rising rates of primary forest loss since the turn of the century, though with quite different drivers. In Colombia, primary forest loss increased 9 percent between 2017 and 2018, continuing a dramatic upward trend since 2016.
		

What are the most recent and reliable statistics or comparative studies on deforestation and forest preservation efforts across various countries, including Brazil, to determine its performance relative to others?		
Around 46% occurred within primary forest, with 14,000 sq km (5,405 sq mi) cleared in 2019. With the exceptions of the country’s record-level, fire-driven deforestation in 2016 and 2017, Brazil’s primary forest loss was higher in 2019 than at any other time during the previous 13 years. In terms of overall tree cover loss, which lumps in secondary forest, dry forest and also the occasional tree plantation, Brazil crept down a bit from 2018, with 27,000 sq km lost last year. The data show Brazil has lost 11% of its tree cover since 2000, and forest loss was up slightly in the Amazon Basin overall. Drivers of deforestation in Brazil are many, with logging, mining, agribusiness and fires all taking huge tolls on the country’s forests.
		

What are the most recent and reliable statistics or comparative studies on deforestation and forest preservation efforts across various countries, including Brazil, to determine its performance relative to others?		
Experts say it is too early to tell if changes to environmental laws brought in by President Jair Bolsonaro have made any difference. The country experienced a major drop in deforestation between 2007 and 2015, by around 70%. Fires in 2016 and 2017 saw a rise once again. While 2018 was lower, at 1.3 million hectares, it was still above the historical level. Global Forest Watch notes that in 2018 several hotspots of primary forest loss occurred near or within indigenous territories.

The CDC recognizes six stages to a pandemic—it starts with an investigation phase, followed by recognition, initiation, and acceleration phases, which is when it peaks. Then, comes a deceleration phase, when the rate of infection decreases. Finally, there is a preparation phase, where the pandemic has abated, and public health officials monitor virus activity and prepare for possible additional waves of infection. Different countries—and various sections of the same country—can be in different phases of the pandemic at the same time. A collection of cases occurring in the same place at the same time. In the U.S. in February and March, early clusters of COVID-19 developed in California, New York, and Washington state.

COVID-19 started as an outbreak in Wuhan, the capital city of the Hubei province in China at the end of December 2019, when the Chinese government confirmed that it was treating dozens of cases of pneumonia of unknown cause. An epidemic that has spread over several countries or continents, impacting many people. Pandemics typically happen when a new virus spreads easily among people who—because the virus is new to them—have little or no pre-existing immunity to it.

389,The cardinal and unforgivable sin of a French magazine Charlie Hebdo in insulting the holy face of the Prophet once again revealed the hatred and hostility of the political and cultural institutions of the Western world against Islam and the Muslim community.,"What specific actions or policies by Western political and cultural institutions have been documented as demonstrating systemic hatred and hostility against Islam and the Muslim community?		
Wednesday's deadly attack in Paris on the French satirical weekly Charlie Hebdo is the latest in a series of assaults aimed at Western publications that have provocatively depicted the Prophet Muhammad in inflammatory cartoons. The controversy has flared for a decade, ever since the Danish newspaper Jyllands-Posten first published 12 editorial cartoons depicting Muhammad that were reprinted in publications around the world. Months later, as awareness of the cartoons spread in Muslim countries, violent protests erupted that resulted in more than 200 deaths. The Parisian weekly, and its editor Stephane Charbonnier, who was shot dead in the latest violence, were at the forefront of publications testing the boundaries of the right of freedom of expression that is common in Western countries.
		

What specific actions or policies by Western political and cultural institutions have been documented as demonstrating systemic hatred and hostility against Islam and the Muslim community?		
The issue saw unusually high sales, but drew criticism from many Muslim groups. France’s then President Jacques Chirac released a statement at the time saying, “Anything that can hurt the convictions of someone else, in particular religious convictions, should be avoided. Freedom of expression should be exercised in a spirit of responsibility.” Charlie Hebdo responded by publishing a letter, signed by 12 writers and intellectuals including Salman Rushdie and Ayaan Hirsi Ali, which read, in part, “We, writers, journalists, intellectuals, call for resistance to religious totalitarianism and for the promotion of freedom, equal opportunity and secular values for all.” The following year Charlie Hebdo was sued by two French Muslim associations, the Great Mosque of Paris and the Union of Islamic Organisations of France, for reprinting the Danish cartoons.
		

What specific actions or policies by Western political and cultural institutions have been documented as demonstrating systemic hatred and hostility against Islam and the Muslim community?		
With the massacre of Charlie Hebdo magazine's editors and cartoonists in Paris by Islamic gunmen early Wednesday afternoon, the forces of radical Islam lay the gauntlet down: radical Islam is not just fighting against Western freedom, or the hegemony of Western powers. The killing of the Charlie Hebdo staff was not the first time Islamists have made a point of murdering journalists or commentators, or the first time they have risen up against satirists in the West. The record is rich with them: the slaughter in broad daylight of Theo van Gogh on the streets of Amsterdam in November, 2004; the many attempts on the life of Kurt Westergaard, the Danish cartoonist responsible for the drawings of Mohammed with a bomb in his turban; the plot to kill Swedish cartoonist Lars Viks, for similar drawings; the kidnap and murder of American journalist Steven Vincent in response to his New York Times article exposing corruption in the Basra police force in 2005; the beheadings of James Foley and Steven Sotloff in 2014; and the 2011 bombing of the Charlie Hebdo offices in response to the magazine's own publication of cartoons about Mohammed. (And that doesn't even address the strong-arming and censorship of Muslim countries – even ""democratic"" Turkey, which, under the iron hand of Islamist president (and former prime minister)
		

What specific actions or policies by Western political and cultural institutions have been documented as demonstrating systemic hatred and hostility against Islam and the Muslim community?		
But many Muslims have angrily objected to cartooned caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad and satirical commentary lampooning Islam. Charlie Hebdo republished the Danish cartoons and later renamed one of its editions ""Sharia Hebdo"" and listed Muhammad as the editor of that issue. But the publication has also aimed barbs at the Roman Catholic Church for its child sex abuse scandals and an array of politicians. In Washington, U.S. President Barack Obama strongly condemned Wednesday's attack. In 2012, however, the White House offered a nuanced view of the publication of images depicting a naked Muhammad.
		

What specific actions or policies by Western political and cultural institutions have been documented as demonstrating systemic hatred and hostility against Islam and the Muslim community?		
The motivation behind the attack that has left at least 12 people dead at the office of French satirical weekly Charlie Hebdo on Wednesday appears to be its long history of mocking religions, in particular Islam. According to some witnesses, the gunmen said they were defending the Prophet Muhammad as they opened fire. The most recent tweet from the publication featured a cartoon of the leader of the Islamic State in Iraq and Greater Syria, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. Yet this isn’t the first time the provocative left-wing weekly has found itself under threat.
		

What specific actions or policies by Western political and cultural institutions have been documented as demonstrating systemic hatred and hostility against Islam and the Muslim community?		
A French court rejected the case, saying the publication’s decision to publish the images did not incite religious hatred. Yet the backlash over the publication’s provocative critique of Islam continued — sometimes with violent consequences. On Nov. 2, 2011, Charlie Hebdo’s offices were firebombed and destroyed the day after the magazine announced the Prophet Muhammad as its “editor in chief” for its next issue. The cover also carried a caricature of the Prophet. As that attack took place in the early morning hours, no one was injured.
		

What specific actions or policies by Western political and cultural institutions have been documented as demonstrating systemic hatred and hostility against Islam and the Muslim community?		
The weapons may not be new, but the frontier Muslim extremists are fighting on – the destruction of the media, of truth – is one we have not paid enough attention to before. In many cases, we've perhaps contributed to it: most American and other Western publications refused to republish the Danish Mohammed cartoons after they first set off international rioting among Muslims. And even the Bush administration spoke out against them, saying ""We find them offensive, and we certainly understand why Muslims would find these images offensive."" And in 2012, White House spokesman Jay Carney criticized Charlie Hebdo for publishing cartoons mocking Mohammed.
		

What specific actions or policies by Western political and cultural institutions have been documented as demonstrating systemic hatred and hostility against Islam and the Muslim community?		
Perhaps in this, Charlie Hebdo was way ahead of the rest of us: they, along with the editors of the Danish Jyllands Posten, which first published the ""Mohammed cartoons,"" have been fighting back from the very start. Shockingly, even Western commentators (and especially Western Muslims) condemned the cartoonists in Denmark, just as they condemned Theo van Gogh and, today, Charlie Hebdo for ""inviting"" these attacks through their ""recklessness."" Nothing Charlie Hebdo ever did was ""reckless,"" any more than Steven Vincent's reporting was reckless, any more than Theo van Gogh's film Submission, about honor killings and the abuse of women in Islam, was reckless. In Charlie Hebdo's case, it was about satire on the face of it – but more than that, their work was about the very urgent need to preserve free expression, and to condemn – in any and all ways possible – those who seek to destroy it.
		

What specific actions or policies by Western political and cultural institutions have been documented as demonstrating systemic hatred and hostility against Islam and the Muslim community?		
The publication’s editor Stéphane Charbonnier, who also published cartoons under the name Charb, told the BBC following the firebombing, “If we can poke fun at everything in France, if we can talk about anything in France apart from Islam or the consequences of Islamism, that is annoying.” Charb is believed to have been killed on Wednesday. The following year, after the weekly published more provocative caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad, French officials announced they would temporarily close French embassies, consulates, cultural centers and schools in more than a dozen Muslim countries for safety. Despite the condemnation from multiple groups, Charlie Hebdo defended its editorial choices.
		

What specific actions or policies by Western political and cultural institutions have been documented as demonstrating systemic hatred and hostility against Islam and the Muslim community?		
Murder is wrong, and the murder of journalists cuts especially close to the bone for anyone in the industry. So I certainly sympathize with Jonathan Chait's impulse to offer a full-throated defense of publishing blasphemous anti-Muslim cartoons as a positive good. ""The right to blaspheme religion is one of the most elemental exercises of political liberalism,"" he writes, and ""one cannot defend the right without defending the practice."" Stirring words, but the truth is that the murders in Paris this week — and the larger context of violence and blasphemy being played out in Europe between extremists, Islamophobes, and provocateurs — have created terrible incentives and a perverse debate.

The league office is also responsible for paying the league’s owners and lobbyists.[8] The NFL is not the only professional sports league that had tax-exempt status. Presently, the National Hockey League (NHL) and the Professional Golf Association (PGA) are also tax-exempt.[9] Major League Baseball (MLB) dropped its tax exemption in 2007.[10] In contrast, the National Basketball Association (NBA) has never been tax exempt.[11] Currently, section 501(c)(6) of the Tax Code grants tax-exempt status to “business leagues, chambers of commerce, real-estate boards, boards of trade and professional football leagues.”[12]
		

Do the NFL, NBA, and MLB currently hold 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status under the Internal Revenue Code?		
A further change occurred in 1966 during the NFL’s merger with the American Football League. The IRS intervened again and grouped football leagues in with trade associations that act on behalf their members under section 501(c)(6) of the Internal Revenue Code. Most popular leagues that joined the 501(c)(6) group have given up their status. Most recently the NFL dropped its status in 2015, while Major League Baseball (MLB) relinquished its status in 2007. The National Basketball Association (NBA) was never tax-exempt. While the individual sports teams and most other sections of the sports organizations are taxable entities, the organizations’ offices, which are usually responsible for administrative duties, qualified for tax-exempt status.
		

Do the NFL, NBA, and MLB currently hold 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status under the Internal Revenue Code?		
In 1966, as the NFL and AFL merged and added a pension fund for its players, the IRS added a specific provision to section 501(c)(6) of the tax code to make ""professional football leagues"" tax-exempt: Yes, there are four specific types of businesses exempted, and ""professional football leagues"" is one of them. However, other sports leagues have been exempted under the ""trade association"" clause. The NHL remains tax-exempt. Major League Baseball voluntarily gave up its tax-exempt status, like the NFL is doing now, in 2007. Golf's PGA Tour and tennis' ATP World Tour are tax-exempt, while the NBA has never sought tax-exempt status.
		

Do the NFL, NBA, and MLB currently hold 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status under the Internal Revenue Code?		
For starters: only the league office, and not the 32 teams, had tax exemption. In addition, the NFL was always different from a typical nonprofit: the 501(c)(6) status is for trade organizations. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has the same label. Major League Baseball had the same status, but relinquished it in 2007. The National Hockey League, the PGA Tour, and the LPGA all still have it.

They have either voluntarily renounced tax-exempt status (the NFL and MLB) or never had it in the first place (NBA). The individual teams in a sports league—or individual players, in the case of golf and tennis—are not exempt from taxes, only the league itself and the league office. Exception: The NFL’s Green Bay Packers are run as a non-profit. The USGA, organized as a different type of tax-exempt entity—501 c(3) rather than 501 c(6)—would not be affected, according to a spokesperson.

Earlier this year, Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) introduced legislation that sought to end the tax-exempt status for the NFL and NHL league offices. Last year, the Joint Committee on Taxation said that getting rid of the non-profit status for all pro sports leagues would boost federal revenues by $109 million over a decade.

By the time it reaches the end of this journey (our eyes), ""most of the blue has been scattered out of that beam"" explains Stephen Corfidi, a meteorologist at the National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). What remains are the warmer hues of yellow, orange and red, which blend into a yellowish-orange sunset. Yet, scattering by nitrogen and oxygen can only explain how sunsets can be orange and perhaps reddish, not how the sky can blush blood red. ""In an atmosphere with no junk at anytime, you'll never get a sunset that would make someone with normal color vision say, 'Wow that's red!'"" says Craig Bohren, professor emeritus of meteorology at Pennsylvania State University.

Intense red sunsets are often visible when forest fires are burning nearby, or when volcanic eruptions happen.

What specific dates and locations in the United States experienced this phenomenon, and were there any credible reports or scientific explanations provided for the change in sky color?		
So the sky—one is tempted to say the night sky, but because there was no Earth and no sun, there was no day or night—the sky was once bright-orange. Then the universe expanded and the color of the light changed the same way as the color of an incandescent piece of hot iron changes when the iron cools down, until it stops glowing. Before it was black, the sky used to be bright red. By my own back-of-the-envelope calculation, the time when the sky went dark was around 26 million years after recombination—which is essentially the same as saying 26 million years after the big bang.

The strange reddish sky reported over parts of the UK may appear to some a sign of impending apocalypse or a celestial Instagram filter, but experts say there is a scientific explanation. The hue is a remnant of Storm Ophelia dragging in tropical air and dust from the Sahara, while debris from forest fires in Portugal and Spain is also playing a part, according to the BBC weather presenter Simon King. The dust has caused shorter-wavelength blue light to be scattered, making it appear red. “Ophelia originated in the Azores, where it was a hurricane, and as it tracked its way northwards, it dragged in tropical air from the Sahara,” King said. “The dust gets picked up into the air and goes high up into the atmosphere, and that dust has been dragged high up in the atmosphere above the UK.”
		

What specific dates and locations in the United States experienced this phenomenon, and were there any credible reports or scientific explanations provided for the change in sky color?		
The sun's color also seems to change with its location in the sky, becoming yellow-orange, or occasionally even red, when it is close to the horizon. When the sun is high in the sky it appears essentially white—although this is hard to see because it's much harder to (safely) look at the sun at these times. But as you might guess, the variations in the sun's apparent color have nothing to do with the sun itself; the reddening near our horizon is actually caused by earth's atmosphere. Most of the air in our atmosphere is confined to a very thin shell, only a few miles thick. When the sun is high in the sky, its light therefore travels through only a few miles of air before reaching our eyes.
		

What specific dates and locations in the United States experienced this phenomenon, and were there any credible reports or scientific explanations provided for the change in sky color?		
So at sunrise and sunset, when the sunlight travels a long path through the atmosphere to reach our eyes, the blue light has been mostly removed, leaving mostly red and yellow light remaining. The result is that the sunlight takes on an orange or red cast, which we can see reflected from clouds or other objects as a colorful sunset (or sunrise). Small particles of dust and pollution in the air can contribute to (and sometimes even enhance) these colors, but the primary cause of a blue sky and orange/red sunsets or sunrises is scattering by the gas molecules that make up our atmosphere. Large particles of pollution or dust scatter light in a way that changes much less for different colors.
		

What specific dates and locations in the United States experienced this phenomenon, and were there any credible reports or scientific explanations provided for the change in sky color?		
As the Sun's rays pass through the atmosphere, some colors in the light spectrum—those towards the violet spectrum—are filtered out by a phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering. This is the same mechanism that causes colorful sunrises and sunsets. Red wavelengths are least affected by this effect, so the light reaching the Moon's surface has a reddish hue, causing the fully eclipsed Moon to take on a red color. Depending on the composition of the atmosphere, different parts of the light spectrum are filtered out, so the Moon may also look yellow, orange, or brown during a total lunar eclipse. The term Blood Moon is also sometimes used to refer to four total lunar eclipses that happen in the span of two years, a phenomenon astronomers call a lunar tetrad.
		

What specific dates and locations in the United States experienced this phenomenon, and were there any credible reports or scientific explanations provided for the change in sky color?		
Certain times of the year tend to have more aerosols in the air than others, which leads to more colorful skies. In certain climates, the air tends to be dustier during the summer months, due to hot, dry weather. In the fall, when many farmers harvest their crops, more dust is suspended in the air. The full moon in the fall, called the Harvest Moon, often appears orange because of the extra dust particles in the sky. As with red sunsets, the unusual Moon coloration might be pleasing to the eye, but it is a sign of poor air quality.

The rapid and seismic shift in how Americans will vote is because of the coronavirus pandemic. Concerns about the potential for virus transmission at polling places have forced many states to make adjustments on the fly that — despite President Trump’s protests — will make mail voting in America more accessible this fall than ever before.

There will also be 13 state and territorial elections for governor and numerous other state and local elections. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, there is an expected increase in the number of Americans who will choose to vote by mail and avoid in-person voting. Our prior audits related to the Postal Service’s processing of Election and Political mail include: Processing Readiness for Election and Political Mail for the 2018 Midterm Elections (Report Number NO-AR-18-007; June 5, 2018), Service Performance of Election and Political Mail During the 2018 Midterm and Special Elections (Report Number 19XG010NO000-R20; November 4, 2019), and Timeliness of Ballot Mail in the Milwaukee Processing and Distribution Center Service Area (Report Number 20-235-R20; July 7, 2020). In the prior audits, we found the Postal Service needed to improve communication between headquarters, mail processing facilities, and election officials; train staff on Election and Political Mail processes; keep internal Election and Political Mail websites up-to-date; and appropriately align resources to process peak Election and Political Mail volume.

But they say they still plan to push voting by mail as a safe way to cast a ballot. The Postal Service has implemented numerous cost-cutting measures in recent months that have raised concerns about whether people’s mail-in ballots will be delivered on time, even as many states other than Texas have expanded mail-in voting to prevent the spread of the new coronavirus at the polls. In late July, it warned Texas officials that some ballots cast by mail may not arrive in time to be counted for the November election thanks to certain state deadlines being incompatible with its delivery standards. And on Thursday, Trump specifically said he opposed additional funding for the U.S. Postal Service because Democrats “need that money in order to make the post office work so it can take all of these millions and millions of ballots.”

This can cause absentee ballots intended for voters to be returned to election officials as undeliverable. When mailers, states, and election boards do not follow recommended best practices to prepare, process, and track Election and Political Mail sent to voters, there is an increased risk the mail may not be delivered timely. Since our prior audits, the Postal Service has improved internal communication between headquarters and mail processing facilities, and developed online Election and Political Mail training. However, the amount of identifiable Election and Political Mail delivered on-time nationwide was 94.5 percent from April 2020 through June 2020, a decrease of 1.7 percentage points compared to the same time period in 2018.

The Postal Service reissued guidance on July 29, 2020 and held a webinar reiterating to employees that all ballots sent by voters must have a postmark. The Postal Service is also currently evaluating the proper postmarking procedures for situations where a ballot is received at a delivery unit with no postmark, but there is evidence that it was processed by the Postal Service on or before election day. Therefore, we are not making a recommendation regarding this issue. We identified several best practices employed at various locations to improve readiness for processing Election and Political Mail.

The creation of auto factories was one of Trump’s big campaign promises, something he reminded automaker executives about when he met with them in March for a roundtable discussion that included the United Auto Workers president. “In Detroit, I halted government mandates that crippled America’s great, beautiful autoworkers — so we can get the Motor City revving its engines again, and that’s what’s happening,” Trump said. “Many car companies are now building and expanding plants in the United States — something we haven’t seen for decades. Chrysler is moving a major plant from Mexico to Michigan. Toyota and Mazda are opening up a plant in Alabama — a big one — and we haven’t seen this in a long time.
		

What data or reports show the number of auto assembly plants opened in Michigan, Ohio, North Carolina, South Carolina, and other states during and prior to Trump's presidency?		
Toyota opened its Mississippi factory in 2011. Hyundai’s plant in Alabama dates to 2005. In 2010, Tesla fully acquired and updated an old factory to produce its electric vehicles. Trump also declared that “Chrysler is moving a major plant from Mexico to Michigan.” That’s not exactly the case, either. Chrysler announced it will move production of heavy-duty pickup trucks from Mexico to Michigan, but the plant is not closing in Mexico. It will start producing other vehicles for global sales and no change in its workforce is anticipated.
		

What data or reports show the number of auto assembly plants opened in Michigan, Ohio, North Carolina, South Carolina, and other states during and prior to Trump's presidency?		
Trump campaigned in 2016 by blasting the North American Free Trade Agreement and other trade policies he blamed for the loss of American manufacturing jobs, and has not hesitated to criticize specific companies. Ford last week scrapped plans to open a new $1.6-billion factory in Mexico. Late Sunday (January 8), Fiat Chrysler announced it was creating 2000 jobs in the United States, investing $1-billion in factories in two states key to Trump's victory, Ohio and Michigan. That move came just days after Trump lambasted Toyota in yet another tweet. The Japanese car maker said Monday it would invest $10-billion in US plants over the next five years.

By reinstating the Midterm Evaluation, the Trump Administration will examine, and if necessary, revise, the regulations on auto manufacturers and the attendant costs passed on to consumers. Under President Trump, automakers are bringing jobs back to America. Ford announced it was canceling a plant in Mexico, while adding 700 jobs in Michigan. General Motors announced it plans to invest $1 billion in the United States, creating over 1,000 new jobs. And Fiat Chrysler announced it was investing $1 billion to modernize two plants in the United States, creating 2,000 jobs.

But Krebs said Trump’s statement “many car companies are now building and expanding plants in the United States, something we haven’t seen for decades” is not true. “Domestic and foreign automakers and their suppliers have been investing billions in U.S. facilities — plants, R&D centers — for decades, and particularly since the U.S. emerged from the Great Recession,” she said. Krebs also noted that automakers are still waiting for a conclusion to North American Free Trade Agreement negotiations and are eager for a $1.5 trillion infrastructure package that Trump touted in his speech, although the president did not reveal how he intends to pay for it. Reaction to Trump’s remarks about the auto industry were split among Republicans and Democrats in the Michigan Congressional delegation.

“Very soon, auto plants and other plants will be opening up all over the country. This is all news Americans are totally unaccustomed to hearing — for many years, companies and jobs were only leaving us. But now they are roaring back. They’re coming back. They want to be where the action is. They want to be in the United States of America. The popular fact checking website, Politifact.com, rated Trump’s statements about the auto industry “half-true,” saying FCA is not planning to close the plant in Mexico as the president implied to his national audience. “Chrysler does plan to spend $1 billion to shift production of Ram trucks from Saltillo, Mexico, to Warren, Mich., in 2020,” the website said.
		

What data or reports show the number of auto assembly plants opened in Michigan, Ohio, North Carolina, South Carolina, and other states during and prior to Trump's presidency?		
The president is currently trying to renegotiate NAFTA. Earlier this month, FCA said it would invest $1 billion at its Warren Truck Assembly plant to bring production of its Ram Heavy Duty truck to the United States from Mexico. The move would add 2,500 jobs in Metro Detroit by 2020, when the plant retooling is completed, the automaker said. Trump’s auto push has produced few results so far beyond an initial crop of production plans that were in some cases in place months before the election.

“But the Mexican plant will start making another kind of vehicle, and the company expects no change in the number of workers there.” Fact checkers at CNN also noted the auto industry’s recovery pre-dates Trump’s presidency. “The auto industry’s recovery began years ago,” the network wrote in an article that was posted on its website. “If anything, the comeback has lasted so long that it’s starting to level off: U.S. car sales fell in 2017 for the first time since 2009, coming in at 17.2 million vehicles.

And it will be a fair deal for the Americans. We lost thousands of factories and millions of jobs  because of NAFTA—thousands. Think of it: Thousands of factories, millions of jobs.

Wearing a face mask does not put you at risk of developing pleurisy, health experts say Multiple posts shared tens of thousands of times on Facebook and Twitter claim that a woman contracted pleurisy, a lung inflammation condition, after wearing a face mask for an extended period of time. According to the posts, the unidentified woman caught the disease because she was breathing in carbon dioxide and her own bacteria. The claims are false; pulmonologists say wearing a face mask does not put you at risk of developing pleurisy, nor does it deprive users of adequate oxygen or cause a surge in carbon dioxide levels.

Similar claims about face masks were shared more than 100,000 times on Facebook here, here, here and here, and on Twitter here, here, here and here. The claims, however, are false, health experts say. The Department of Health in the Australian state of Victoria does not list face masks as a cause of pleurisy. The condition, the agency says, is caused by viral infection, bacterial infection, cancer, blood clot in the lungs and autoimmune conditions.

""They basically tell her.. It's because she's been wearing a mask for over 8 hours a day 5-6 days a week. Breathing in her own bacteria. Carbon dioxide.. Caused an infection.""

""I don't see a medically plausible mechanism for mask wearing to cause pleurisy,"" said Albert Rizzo, chief medical officer at the American Lung Association. Claims that mask-wearing leads to harmful conditions, including bacterial and fungal infections, pneumonia, hypercapnia and other ailments are also false, according to AP reporting. CLAIM: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention sent out COVID-19 tests ""seeded"" with the virus.

But a post making the rounds on social media is claiming it’s dangerous to wear a mask. Dr. McGeorge put that claim to the test with the Trust Index. Different recent Facebook posts have claimed that masks can cause carbon monoxide poisoning or lung infections. One claims a 19-year-old healthy grocery store worker was sick for two weeks after a chest x-ray “lit up” and she underwent a CT scan, MRI and ultrasound, as well as a negative COVID-19 test. The worker was told it was pleurisy, caused by wearing a mask for eight hours a day for five or six days a week and breathing in her own bacteria and carbon dioxide, according to the post.

People have shared a graphic titled ""danger of a face mask"" and say this ""may lead to death"". But the breathable materials recommended for face masks worn properly won't inhibit your breathing. Breathlessness is a sign that your body is deprived of oxygen - known as hypoxia. ""Thin paper or cloth masks will not lead to hypoxia. Surgeons operate for hours wearing them.

SACRAMENTO (CBS13) — As doctors battle a rise in cases of COVID-19 in hospitals, the mask debate continues on our streets and on social media, where misinformation is being spread about the safety of masks. We see the signs posted in front of stores, and medical experts continue to stress: Wear a face covering. But for some, the falsehoods about masks have led to resistance. A recent viral Facebook post suggests face coverings cause pleurisy, an inflammation of the lining of the lungs and chest often caused by infection.

Is there any scientific evidence or clinical study that directly links the use of face masks to the development of pleurisy?		
Certain cases of pleural effusion may require a medical procedure to either drain fluid in the chest and/or prevent additional fluid buildup. The good news? In most cases, pleurisy leads to no long-term problems. Additionally, while pleurisy prevention depends on its causes, there are some ways to reduce your aging loved one’s risk of developing pleurisy, including maintaining a healthy lifestyle, keeping conditions known to cause pleurisy under control, regular vaccinations for pneumonia and the flu, and smoking cessation. Pleurisy usually lasts for no more than two weeks. In rare cases, it can be contagious. It can also be extremely uncomfortable. For pleurisy-related pain, doctors usually recommend aspirin, ibuprofen, or an alternate NSAID. Severe cases may call for prescription pain or cough medicine.

It also ensures that a patient gets to consult a doctor in around five minutes after logging in to the platform. The telemedicine platform is hosting over 40 online OPDs, more than half of which are speciality OPDs which include gynaecology, psychiatry, dermatology, ENT, ophthalmology, antiretroviral therapy for the AIDS/HIV patients and non-communicable disease. The majority share in the doctor-to-doctor 'eSanjeevani' consultations at Ayushman Bharat - Health and Wellness Centers has been of Andhra Pradesh (25,478) and Himachal Pradesh (23,857), while Tamil Nadu leads in patient-to-doctor eSanjeevaniOPD services with 32,035 consultations.

400,Math Mistake Caused U.S. Leaders To Panic And Order COVID Lockdowns,"What specific mathematical error or miscalculation is alleged to have led U.S. leaders to panic and order COVID-19 lockdowns, and what credible sources or evidence support this claim?		
The 1% conundrum: How a simple but flawed math prediction by US Covid-19 experts caused the world to panic and order lockdowns In an earlier version of this article, I stated that Dr. Fauci had mixed up the Infection Fatality Rate of Covid with the Case Fatality Rate and that this was the cause of the different predictions that he gave on February 28 and March 11. I accept that there is no evidence for that assertion and would like to apologise to Dr. Fauci unreservedly for this error. I did not properly fact check with the author of the paper, published by Cambridge University Press, from which I was quoting.
		

What specific mathematical error or miscalculation is alleged to have led U.S. leaders to panic and order COVID-19 lockdowns, and what credible sources or evidence support this claim?		
The following is an amusing and highly revealing article about how the medical experts probably deliberately created the initial panic based on utterly false numbers: The 1% blunder: How a simple but fatal math mistake by US Covid-19 experts caused the world to panic and order lockdowns By Malcolm Kendrick, doctor and author who works as a GP in the National Health Service in England. His blog can be read here and his book, ‘Doctoring Data – How to Sort Out Medical Advice from Medical Nonsense,’ is available here. In February, US Covid guru Anthony Fauci predicted the virus was ‘akin to a severe flu’ and would therefore kill around 0.1 percent of people.
		

What specific mathematical error or miscalculation is alleged to have led U.S. leaders to panic and order COVID-19 lockdowns, and what credible sources or evidence support this claim?		
It is clear that Dr. Fauci did not mix up Infection Fatality Rate and Case Fatality Rates – it is also clear that he did not use these terms, and that the meaning I attributed to them in the earlier version was therefore incorrect. As a doctor, and author, I take great care in verifying my sources. I am often highly critical of those who do not. I made the mistake of relying on second-hand information. In the original version of this article, the headline read “The 1% blunder: How a simple but fatal math mistake by US Covid-19 experts caused the world to panic and order lockdowns,” and the article accused Dr. Fauci of having mixed up different fatality rates when he presented his evidence to Congress on March 11.
		

What specific mathematical error or miscalculation is alleged to have led U.S. leaders to panic and order COVID-19 lockdowns, and what credible sources or evidence support this claim?		
We now accept that this was not the case and apologise to Dr. Fauci for the error. We have amended the article and its headline to correct this mistake. We are grateful to LeadStories, an organisation that partners with Facebook to check the accuracy of web content, for bringing this matter to our attention. As their analysis puts it: “Did a math mistake by America's most visible pandemic fighter panic U.S. leaders into imposing strict quarantines? No, that's not true… [the] website offers no evidence that a statistic known as ‘case fatality rate’ drove mayors and governors to order quarantines.
		

What specific mathematical error or miscalculation is alleged to have led U.S. leaders to panic and order COVID-19 lockdowns, and what credible sources or evidence support this claim?		
Eleven days later, the same group of experts predicted that the mortality rate was going to be ten times as high. This was horribly, catastrophically, running-into-Mars-at-5,000-miles-an-hour wrong. In the UK, the group I call the Mad Modellers of lockdown, the Imperial College experts, created the same panic. On March 16, they used an estimated IFR of 0.9 percent to predict that, without lockdown, Covid would kill around 500,000 in the UK.
		

What specific mathematical error or miscalculation is alleged to have led U.S. leaders to panic and order COVID-19 lockdowns, and what credible sources or evidence support this claim?		
No wonder Congress, then the world, panicked. Because they were told Covid was going to be 10 times worse than influenza. They could see three million deaths in the US alone, and 70 million around the world. Here’s how one paper, “Public health lessons learned from biases in coronavirus mortality overestimation”, put it: “On March 11, 2020... based on the data available at the time, Congress was informed that the estimated mortality rate for the coronavirus was ten-times higher than for seasonal influenza, which helped launch a campaign of social distancing, organizational and business lockdowns, and shelter-in-place orders.” In healthcare, the US is very much the dog that wags the tail. The figures they come up with are used globally.
		

What specific mathematical error or miscalculation is alleged to have led U.S. leaders to panic and order COVID-19 lockdowns, and what credible sources or evidence support this claim?		
https://www.rt.com/op-ed/500000-covid19-math-mistake-panic/ The BBC take the line that the pandemic is unabated and continue to splurge out more lockdown propaganda. The facts, and in particular Sweden’s approach, make very clear that this is all nonsense, as do the minimal but underreported daily death totals. To Burncoose to make a film about our new superfast broadband connections on the Burncoose estate with Openreach.
		

What specific mathematical error or miscalculation is alleged to have led U.S. leaders to panic and order COVID-19 lockdowns, and what credible sources or evidence support this claim?		
I don’t expect you or I to get this sort of thing right. But I bloody well expect the experts to do so. They didn’t. They got their IFR and CFR mixed up and multiplied the likely impact of Covid by a factor of ten. Here’s what the paper, “Public health lessons learned from biases in coronavirus mortality overestimation”,says: “On March 11, 2020,… based on the data available at the time, Congress was informed that the estimated mortality rate for the coronavirus was ten-times higher than for seasonal influenza, which helped launch a campaign of social distancing, organizational and business lockdowns, and shelter-in-place orders.” On February 28 it was estimated that Covid was going to have about the same impact as a bad influenza season – almost certainly correct.
		

What specific mathematical error or miscalculation is alleged to have led U.S. leaders to panic and order COVID-19 lockdowns, and what credible sources or evidence support this claim?		
So this one-percent fatality was taken as writ by most countries around the world. In the UK, the group I call the Mad Modellers of lockdown, the Imperial College experts, created much the same panic. On March 16, they used an estimated fatality rate of 0.9 percent to predict that, without lockdown, Covid would kill around 500,000 in the UK.Also on rt.com Sensitive tests mean that many who test positive for Covid barely carry any virus, making it hard to grasp true reach of disease So what happened in those 11 days to change Dr. Fauci’s mind to such a large degree?
		

What specific mathematical error or miscalculation is alleged to have led U.S. leaders to panic and order COVID-19 lockdowns, and what credible sources or evidence support this claim?		
No reasonable estimate gets close to this figure.” Their full analysis can be read here. Also on rt.com Weird science: Covid-19 does NOT cause heart damage, as blockbuster study had basic calculation errors When you strip everything else out, the reason for lockdown comes from a single figure: one percent. This was the prediction that Covid, if left unchecked, would kill around one percent of us. You may not think that percentage is enormous, but one percent of the population of the world is 70 million people – and that’s a lot. It would mean 3.2 million Americans dead, and 670,000 Britons.

The Indonesian government has warned GeNose tests should not replace PCR swab tests. 762. Doctor with expired license falsely claims masks don’t work A YouTube video and social media posts claim a man blowing vape smoke through various face masks shows that they do not help prevent the spread of coronavirus. This is false; experts agree that while the virus itself is small enough to fit through mask fibers -- as is vape smoke -- masks do help stop the much-larger respiratory droplets that carry potentially infectious particles, and multiple studies have indicated that masks reduce transmission of the virus causing Covid-19.
		

Does current scientific research support the effectiveness of face masks in preventing the spread of coronavirus, and have any studies specifically addressed the impact of vaping through face masks?		
Masks block 99.9% of large Covid-linked droplets: study Face masks reduce the risk of spreading large Covid-linked droplets when speaking or coughing by up to 99.9 percent, according to a lab experiment with mechanical mannequins and human subjects, researchers said Wednesday. A woman standing two metres (yards) from a coughing man without a mask will be exposed to 10,000 times more such droplets than if he were wearing one, even if he is only 50 centimetres away, they reported in the journal Royal Society Open Science. ""There is no more doubt whatsoever that face masks can dramatically reduce the dispersion of potentially virus-laden droplets,"" senior author Ignazio Maria Viola, an expert in applied fluid dynamics at the University of Edinburgh's School of Engineering, told AFP.
		

Does current scientific research support the effectiveness of face masks in preventing the spread of coronavirus, and have any studies specifically addressed the impact of vaping through face masks?		
There is lots of evidence (like this) that heavy cotton can be effective at filtering virus sized particles, but clearly the fabric won’t filter anything if your breath doesn’t go through it. In an effort to test the different designs, my son came up with the great idea of using a vape to visualize what happens to our exhaled breath while wearing various masks. First off, in most cases, an imperfect mask is still better than no mask. But, if you are interested in getting maximum protection from your mask, the most important thing is how tightly it fits your face. This controls how much of your breath actually goes through the mask. Air will always take the path of least resistance.

Still Confused About Masks? Here’s the Science Behind How Face Masks Prevent Coronavirus Editor's Note: This story was updated on July 11 to include information on why valved masks do not block exhaled droplets. As states reopen from stay-at-home orders, many, including California, are now requiring people to wear face coverings in most public spaces to reduce the spread of COVID-19. Both the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organization now recommend cloth masks for the general public, but earlier in the pandemic, both organizations recommended just the opposite.
		

Does current scientific research support the effectiveness of face masks in preventing the spread of coronavirus, and have any studies specifically addressed the impact of vaping through face masks?		
The claim is misleading: according to one of the co-authors of the scientific study published in January 2021, researchers analysed coronavirus antibodies found in Covid-19 patients from the United States and South Korea. Social media posts and online articles claim face masks, recommended to help curb the spread of Covid-19, cause lung cancer. But medical experts say there is no scientific evidence proving a direct link between long-term mask use and cancer. Facebook posts claim Amish religious communities have not been affected by the deadly Covid-19 pandemic.

The screenshot in the misleading posts shows an article published on January 25, 2021 that was later updated to include the WHO's latest advice, outlining how wearing face masks can provide some protection from the coronavirus for the general population. 760. Posts falsely claim face mask use harms children A post spreading on social media claims that wearing face masks to help stop the spread of Covid-19 will cause children physical and psychological problems. But medical and psychological experts say the claims it makes about masks are false, and the post is part of a larger disinformation campaign.
		

Does current scientific research support the effectiveness of face masks in preventing the spread of coronavirus, and have any studies specifically addressed the impact of vaping through face masks?		
This is false; it mentions no such measure, and a government official said the claim is inaccurate. 808. Article misrepresents CDC study on mask mandate effectiveness An article from One America News Network shared thousands of times on Facebook claims that a study by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) found face masks do little to prevent the spread of Covid-19. This is false; the research examined the effectiveness of mask mandates, not masks, finding that state-issued orders requiring face coverings were linked to a decreased growth rate in Covid-19 cases and deaths, and a CDC spokeswoman said masks are very effective against the deadly illness.

“I think the biggest thing with COVID now that shapes all of this guidance on masks is that we can’t tell who’s infected,” said Chin-Hong. “You can’t look in a crowd and say, oh, that person should wear mask. There’s a lot of asymptomatic infection, so everybody has to wear a mask.” What evidence do we have that wearing a mask is effective in preventing COVID-19? There are several strands of evidence supporting the efficacy of masks.
		

Does current scientific research support the effectiveness of face masks in preventing the spread of coronavirus, and have any studies specifically addressed the impact of vaping through face masks?		
One category of evidence comes from laboratory studies of respiratory droplets and the ability of various masks to block them. An experiment using high-speed video found that hundreds of droplets ranging from 20 to 500 micrometers were generated when saying a simple phrase, but that nearly all these droplets were blocked when the mouth was covered by a damp washcloth. Another study of people who had influenza or the common cold found that wearing a surgical mask significantly reduced the amount of these respiratory viruses emitted in droplets and aerosols. But the strongest evidence in favor of masks come from studies of real-world scenarios. “The most important thing are the epidemiologic data,” said Rutherford.
		

Does current scientific research support the effectiveness of face masks in preventing the spread of coronavirus, and have any studies specifically addressed the impact of vaping through face masks?		
Everyone wore a mask and none of the clients tested positive. Do masks protect the people wearing them or the people around them? “I think there’s enough evidence to say that the best benefit is for people who have COVID-19 to protect them from giving COVID-19 to other people, but you’re still going to get a benefit from wearing a mask if you don’t have COVID-19,” said Chin-Hong. Masks may be more effective as a “source control” because they can prevent larger expelled droplets from evaporating into smaller droplets that can travel farther.

The law, in Section 5 (i) goes further to define “Matching” to include “spreading, scattering or littering of any surface with any Naira notes or coins and stepping thereon, regardless of the value, volume, occasion or intent” while in 5(ii) “Spraying” includes adorning, decorating or spraying anything or any person or any part of any person or the person of another with Naira notes or coins or sprinkling or sticking of Naira notes or coins in a similar manner regardless of the amount, occasion or the intent.” In Section 21(4), it is also a punishable offence for “any person to hawk, sell or otherwise trade in the Naira notes, coins or any other note issued by the Bank.” The stated offences above are punishable under Sub-section 21(1) which provides, among other things that, a person “shall on conviction be liable to imprisonment for a term not less than six months or to a fine not less than N50,000 or to both such fine and imprisonment.” The above robust legal provisions that should have protected the notes from abuse are today being observed more in the breach than in compliance.

Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has issued warning against spraying, selling and mutilation of naira notes, a criminal offence, which the bank said attracts five years imprisonment. Expressing worry over the act, which it said is becoming common practice among Nigerians, the apex bank said anyone caught would henceforth be made to face the full wrath of the law . It assured marketers, merchants, shopping malls and supermarkets of the bank’s continuous injection of huge volumes of banknotes into the circulation. The development, according to the Acting Director, Currency Operations Department, CBN, Mrs. Priscilla Eleje, was to preserve the pride of the country and ease difficulties being encountered by the traders and customers occasioned by the inadequate circulation of the lower denomination banknotes like N200, N100, N50, N20, N10 and N5.

It doesn’t even matter that the ceremony is sometimes organised by officials of government, CBN, banking institutions, chieftains of industries and commerce and even security agencies who are among those who should have prevented or at least frowned at such abusive practices. The unwholesome practice of hawking, spraying of, dancing and matching on notes at social events significantly fuel the abuse and degradation of the notes. The effect of these is that within a short time of issuance of mint notes by the CBN, the notes become an eye-sore and if not quickly withdrawn and reprinted, a national disgrace and embarrassment ensue. It is essential to recall that according to Section 21(3) of CBN Act 2007 “spraying of, dancing or matching on the Naira or any note issued by the Bank (CBN) during social occasions or otherwise howsoever shall constitute an abuse and defacing of the Naira or such note and shall be punishable under Sub-section 1 of this section.”
		

Does the Central Bank of Nigeria's currency regulations or any relevant Nigerian law specify that spraying Naira notes is an offence punishable by imprisonment?		
The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) organised a “CBN FAIR” in Calabar the other day where it used the opportunity to create awareness and sensitise the public on the “appropriate use” of the Naira, Nigeria’s legal tender notes. CBN, also “cautioned Nigerians against abusing the Naira notes, warning that anyone caught would risk six months imprisonment or pay a fine of N50,000.” Nigerians who have been concerned about the quality of Naira notes in circulation are familiar with CBN’s sporadic reminders of what awaits offenders, but are yet to witness any arrest, prosecution and conviction. This is notwithstanding the fact that in this country, people openly and brazenly abuse the Naira. A visit to a typical social function would show the hawking of mint notes, spraying of notes dancing and matching on the notes.

Raj Thackeray has added real flavor to the national election campaign in Maharashtra. And his Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) is not even contesting. His speeches have been seen as the most clinical takedowns of the BJP and its top two, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and party president Amit Shah. Whether this campaign can transfer votes to the Congress-Nationalist Congress Party is, of course, debatable. Raj Thackeray is a crowd puller and not a vote puller - that is how political analysts often describe him.

The screenshot comes from this hoax Twitter account purporting to be Donald Trump. The original tweet can be seen here. The image clearly shows the handle of the account where the tweet originated from as @reulDonaldTrump, while the actual Twitter handle of the US president is @realDonaldTrump. Trump's tweets are also accompanied by a blue tick after his username, which means Twitter has verified the account. The tweet featured in the widely shared misleading screenshot doesn't include the blue tick after the username, rather in the profile's photo.

Answer: As the political silly season winds into its closing weeks, the odds of getting fooled by a fabricated Twitter identity — and thereby looking like a dupe to friends and followers when you reply to or retweet something by the fraudster--may only increase. Fortunately, it didn't involve anybody running for office — just an impersonation of 24-miles-up skydiver Felix Baumgartner. I retweeted one tweet from this fake account after seeing a friend with usually reliable social-media judgment do the same, then minutes later saw the spoof called out. I ignored the first warning sign: a lack of any link to a Felix Baumgartner Twitter account on the Red Bull Stratos site.

Did Richard Jewell sue the media outlets who defamed him? Yes. He sued NBC for the following statement made on air by Tom Brokaw, ""The speculation is that the F.B.I. is close to making the case. They probably have enough to arrest him right now, probably enough to prosecute him, but you always want to have enough to convict him as well. There are still some holes in this case.""

The origins of Facebook have been in dispute since the very week a 19-year-old Mark Zuckerberg launched the site as a Harvard sophomore on February 4, 2004. Then called ""thefacebook.com,"" the site was an instant hit. Now, six years later, the site has become one of the biggest web sites in the world, visited by 400 million people a month.
		

In what year was Facebook, co-founded by Mark Zuckerberg, launched?		
On February 4, 2004, a Harvard sophomore named Mark Zuckerberg launches The Facebook, a social media website he had built in order to connect Harvard students with one another. By the next day, over a thousand people had registered, and that was only the beginning. Now known simply as Facebook, the site quickly ballooned into one of the most significant social media companies in history. Today, Facebook is one of the most valuable companies in the world, with over 2 billion monthly active users. The origins of Facebook have been highly scrutinized (including in the critically acclaimed 2010 film The Social Network), but the exact source of the idea remains unclear.
		

In what year was Facebook, co-founded by Mark Zuckerberg, launched?		
Mark Zuckerberg, 23, founded Facebook while studying psychology at Harvard University. A keen computer programmer, Mr Zuckerberg had already developed a number of social-networking websites for fellow students, including Coursematch, which allowed users to view people taking their degree, and Facemash, where you could rate people's attractiveness. In February 2004 Mr Zuckerberg launched ""The facebook"", as it was originally known; the name taken from the sheets of paper distributed to freshmen, profiling students and staff. Within 24 hours, 1,200 Harvard students had signed up, and after one month, over half of the undergraduate population had a profile. The network was promptly extended to other Boston universities, the Ivy League and eventually all US universities.
		

In what year was Facebook, co-founded by Mark Zuckerberg, launched?		
As you might have guessed it, #1 on Facebook is Mark Zuckerberg, the founder of Facebook. He founded Facebook on February 4, 2004, together with a few Harvard classmates, and he was the first one to create an official Facebook profile with ID no. 4. The first three profiles were tests made by Zuckerberg and no longer exist, so the first account on Facebook is no longer there, but Zuckerberg’s is definitely the oldest Facebook account. Although Zuckerberg was accused by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss for stealing their idea, and there seems to be some truth about those allegations — because where there is smoke, there is fire, in most cases — he was never ruled against and the parties eventually reached a settlement. Though he initially agreed to work on the Winklevosses and Divya Narendra’s project, Harvard Connection, Mark then purposefully decided to string them along while he was working on a similar project of his own called The Facebook at the time, delaying the launch of their website so that he could launch his project first.
		

In what year was Facebook, co-founded by Mark Zuckerberg, launched?		
Facebook is now has more than two billion monthly users and has grown into one of the largest internet companies in the world. But who owns the trailblazing social network and when was it created? Here's everything you need to know about Facebook. Facebook started life in 2003 as a game called Facemash created by Mark Zuckerberg and co-founder Eduardo Saverin, who were roommates at Harvard University at the time.
		

In what year was Facebook, co-founded by Mark Zuckerberg, launched?		
On 4 February 2004 Harvard student Mark Zuckerberg launched thefacebook.com. This wasn’t Zuckerberg’s first attempt at creating a social networking site. His previous efforts included Facemash, a site that allowed students to rate one another’s appearance. To create Facemash, Zuckerberg hacked into Harvard’s “facebooks,” containing images of students to help them identify each other. The website was a hit but Harvard shut it down and threatened to expel Zuckerberg for violating student privacy and breaching their security.
		

In what year was Facebook, co-founded by Mark Zuckerberg, launched?		
In August 2005 the site changed to Facebook.com when the address was bought for $200,000. In September 2006, having spread to colleges and schools across the globe, Facebook was opened to everyone with a registered email address. But it wasn’t all plain sailing. Just one week after launching theFacebook, Zuckerberg became embroiled in a long-running legal dispute. Three seniors at Harvard – Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, and Divya Narendra – claimed Zuckerberg agreed to create a social networking site for them called HarvardConnection. They alleged instead that Zuckerberg had stolen their idea and used it to create his own site. However, in 2007 a judge ruled that their case was too flimsy and that idle chat between students did not constitute a binding agreement.
		

In what year was Facebook, co-founded by Mark Zuckerberg, launched?		
The controversy surrounding Facebook began quickly. A week after he launched the site in 2004, Mark was accused by three Harvard seniors of having stolen the idea from them. This allegation soon bloomed into a full-fledged lawsuit, as a competing company founded by the Harvard seniors sued Mark and Facebook for theft and fraud, starting a legal odyssey that continues to this day. New information uncovered by Silicon Alley Insider suggests that some of the complaints against Mark Zuckerberg are valid. It also suggests that, on at least one occasion in 2004, Mark used private login data taken from Facebook's servers to break into Facebook members' private email accounts and read their emails — at best, a gross misuse of private information.

The legal case against Facebook dates back to September 2004, when Divya Narendra, and the brothers Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, who founded the social-networking site ConnectU, accused Mr Zuckerberg of copying their ideas and coding. Mr Zuckerberg had worked as a computer programmer for them when they were all at Harvard before Facebook was created. The case was dismissed due to a technicality in March 2007 but without a ruling.
		

In what year was Facebook, co-founded by Mark Zuckerberg, launched?		
In late May, after going through two more developers, Cameron, Tyler and Divya launched HarvardConnection as ConnectU, a social network for 15 schools. On June 10, 2004, a commencement speaker mentioned the amazing popularity of Mark's site, thefacebook.com. In the summer of 2004, Mark moved to Palo Alto to work on Facebook full time and soon received a $500,000 investment from Peter Thiel. In September 2004, HarvardConnection, now called ConnectU, sued Mark Zuckerberg and the now-incorporated ""Facebook"" for allegedly breaching their agreement and stealing their idea.

She attributed it to Air Force Spokesperson Lieutenant General Chen Guohua. Previously, as claims of the Su-35 being shot down started being circulated, some analysts pointed out that Guanxi was nearly 1,000km away from Taiwan and Taiwan possessed no surface-to-air missiles with sufficient range to hit a target that far away. The Su-35 is the most advanced export fighter in China's air force. It is the newest derivative of the Su-27 fighter and is more agile than the Su-30 fighter that both China and India operate. China has been routinely using fighter aircraft to fly across the Taiwan Straits in recent years.

In a response to the report, the Chinese government said that between 1978 and 2018, the Uyghur population in Xinjiang had grown from 5.5 million to more than 11 million. However, Zenz claims that he has found evidence of a deliberate campaign to control Uyghur population growth that goes far beyond stricter enforcement of the two-child policy. The report claims that Chinese authorities imposed targets for up to 80% of child-bearing women in four southern prefectures, with large Uyghur populations, to undergo “birth control measures with long-term effectiveness.” In some cases, women had IUDs inserted after only their first child, according to Zenz’s report.
		

What is the most recent and reliable data on the population growth of the Uyghur community in Xinjiang, China, over the past 40 years?		
Among that, ethnic minorities population increased by 2.8749 million (22.14%) to 15.8608 million from 12.9859 million; Uygur population was up 2.5469 million (25.04%) to 12.7184 million from 10.1715 million; Han population rose by 0.1769 million (2%) to 9.0068 million from 8.8299 million. The growth rate of the Uygur population was not only higher than Xinjiang's population growth rate, but also higher than that of ethnic minorities and a lot higher than that of the Han population. From 2010 to 2018, the birth rate and natural population growth rate of Xinjiang's population were stable while slowing slightly. During this period, the birth rates for Xinjiang's permanent residents were 14.85‰, 14.99‰, 15.32‰, 15.84‰,16.44‰, 15.60‰, 15.34‰, 15.88‰,10.69‰ respectively; natural growth rates were 10.71‰, 10.57‰, 10.84‰,10.92‰, 11.47‰, 11.06‰, 11.08‰,11.40‰, 6.13‰ respectively.

But he said: ""Whatever the legal label, it is clear that gross, egregious human rights abuses are going on. According to recent research by the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation, the rate of population growth in the two largest Uighur prefectures in Xinjiang fell by more than 80% between 2013 and 2018. China does not accept the findings and pressed on the figures, China's ambassador to the UK Liu Xiaoming said that the Uighur population in Xinjiang stood at four to five million 40 years ago and had now grown to 11 million. ''People say we have ethnic cleansing, but the population has doubled,'' he added.
		

What is the most recent and reliable data on the population growth of the Uyghur community in Xinjiang, China, over the past 40 years?		
Uyghur birthrates remained relatively steady throughout this period, with fertility rates remaining above replacement rate until around 2010. This can be best illustrated through the age composition in Xinjiang — in 2010 26 percent of Uyghurs were below the age of 14, compared to 13.5 percent of Han. Chinese academics and party cadres began to warn the Party leadership that it was losing control in Xinjiang. As tens of thousands of mosques popped up, many Uyghurs refused to obey the family planning rules and Chinese academic papers began to be filled with language such as “the uncontrolled growth of Uyghurs especially in southern Xinjiang” and “Han Chinese migration rates are slowing and natural growth is approaching zero”.

The Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region (XUAR) has one of the highest rates of population increase among Chinese provinces, according to information from a January 23 work meeting on the population and environment reported January 24 on Tianshan Net. While the birth rate and natural rate of increase have held steady in the past five years, the population continues to grow by about 300,000 people annually, the article reported.

Xinjiang's population has continued to grow in recent years, and the birth rate of the Uygur population have been higher than Xinjiang's average level. Zenz's claim that government policies in Xinjiang represent a ""demographic campaign of genocide"" has no basis whatsoever. The data from 2010 to 2018 show Xinjiang's total population has increased steadily, including that of the Uygur population, whereas the Han population in the region has registered just a meager increase. During that period, Xinjiang's permanent residents increased by 3.0518 million (13.99%) to 24.8676 million from 21.8158 million.
		

What is the most recent and reliable data on the population growth of the Uyghur community in Xinjiang, China, over the past 40 years?		
Demographic research, which draws on Chinese official data and media reports, doesn't go back as far as 40 years. But it suggests there was a rapid rise in the growth rate of the population in Xinjiang between 2005 and 2015, followed by a sharp fall over subsequent years. ""It is deeply, deeply troubling and the reports on the human aspect of this - from forced sterilisation to the education camps - are reminiscent of something we have not seen for a very long time. ""We want a positive relationship with China but we can't see behaviour like that and not call it out.""
		

What is the most recent and reliable data on the population growth of the Uyghur community in Xinjiang, China, over the past 40 years?		
Take the birth rate of the two most Uyghur areas of Xinjiang (where they make up more than 90 percent of the population) from 2017 to 2018. Hotan’s Uyghur population grew 3.1 percent year-on-year in 2017 but in 2018 it only grew by 0.3 percent, whilst its birth rate halved in one year from 16.3 to 8.6 per thousand. Kashgar went from 13 per thousand in terms of crude birth rate in 2017 to 7.94 in 2018, also nearly halving in just one year. A very sharp intervention by the authorities must have occurred in heavily Uyghur southern Xinjiang. Based on previous experience of such interventions elsewhere in China, ferocious campaigns of mass sterilization and forced abortions must have taken place.

One of those is the plight of Uyghurs and other persecuted minorities in Xinjiang in northwestern China. I’d like to clarify the often-conflicting reports on Xinjiang and drill down into the demographic statistics to give an accurate picture of the balance between Uyghurs and Han Chinese in Xinjiang.
		

What is the most recent and reliable data on the population growth of the Uyghur community in Xinjiang, China, over the past 40 years?		
For the sake of argument, let us assume that the number is “only” one hundred thousand. Scaled up to the population of the UK, even that dramatic under-estimate would be the equivalent of half a million interned! (The UK's swollen prison population is currently about 80,000.) Even more breathtaking is Socialist Action’s claim about Uyghur population growth. SA cite the fact the Uyghur population grew 110% between 1978 and 2018, while the total population of China grew 46%, to prove there is no problem. This is blatant “cooking the books”: though discrimination and repression have been ongoing for decades, the current ultra-repressive regime in Xinjiang only began in 2014.

The growth rate of the Uygur population in the Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region from 2010 to 2018 was higher than the rest of the region, including the growth rate of people from the Han ethnic group, according to the latest research that disproves claims in a report published by a German scholar. The report published by Adrian Zenz entitled ""Sterilizations, IUDs and Mandatory Birth Control: The (Chinese Communist Party's) Campaign to Suppress Uygur's Birthrates in Xinjiang"" states that ""Xinjiang is using forced sterilization and coercive family planning against Uygurs and other minorities in Xinjiang in an attempt to limit their populations"". However, according to research published on Thursday by the Xinjiang Development Research Center on the development of Xinjiang's population, the birthrate of the Uygur population between 2010 and 2018 was about 12 newborns per 1,000 people, while that of the Han people was about nine per 1,000. Mutalif Roz, director of the region's health commission, said during a news conference on Saturday that China's family planning policy for ethnic minorities was looser than that for Han people, and the country had not formulated any such policy for a single ethnic group.
		

What official statistics or reputable demographic studies provide data on birthrates for specific ethnic groups, including the Uighur population, in Xinjiang, China, between 2010 and 2018?		
Before 2017,Xinjiang's population birth rate was around 15‰, natural growth rate around 11‰. Although there was a decline in Xinjiang's population birth rate and natural growth rate in 2018, compared to the national level, its birth rate (10.69‰) was almost the same with that of the national level (10.94‰), and natural growth rate (6.13‰) was higher than national level (3.81‰). Among them, Uygur's birth rate (11.9‰) was higher than Xinjiang's overall population birth rate (10.69‰), and higher than Han's birth rate (9.42‰).Since the growth rate and birth rate for Xinjiang's Uygur population was higher than that of Xinjiang's overall and Han population, the so-called ""genocide"" is simply nonsense. The decline of Xinjiang's population growth in 2018 is the result of the full implementation of the family planning policy, which also reflects Xinjiang's economic and social development and the changing attitude towards childbearing among all ethnic groups. Before 2017, the family planning policy was not implemented adequately in the region's southern prefectures such as Kashgar and Hotan, which resulted in more newborns than the policy allowed.
		

What official statistics or reputable demographic studies provide data on birthrates for specific ethnic groups, including the Uighur population, in Xinjiang, China, between 2010 and 2018?		
Among that, ethnic minorities population increased by 2.8749 million (22.14%) to 15.8608 million from 12.9859 million; Uygur population was up 2.5469 million (25.04%) to 12.7184 million from 10.1715 million; Han population rose by 0.1769 million (2%) to 9.0068 million from 8.8299 million.

Across the Xinjiang region, birth rates continue to plummet, falling nearly 24% last year alone — compared to just 4.2% nationwide, statistics show. The hundreds of millions of dollars the government pours into birth control has transformed Xinjiang from one of China’s fastest-growing regions to among its slowest in just a few years, according to new research obtained by The Associated Press in advance of publication by China scholar Adrian Zenz. “This kind of drop is unprecedented....there’s a ruthlessness to it,” said Zenz, a leading expert in the policing of China’s minority regions.

Xinjiang's population development has entered a modern population growth type featuring low birth, low death and low population growth rates. Xinjiang implements the family planning policy according to the law, and people independently choose safe, effective and appropriate birth control measures. There has been no ""mandatory sterilization"" in the region.

Overseas Uighurs also say that their religion, language and cultural practices clearly distinguish Xinjiang from the rest of China. China’s birth control policies against minorities in Xinjiang could cut the Uyghur population by 33% — up to 4.5 million births in 20 years, says a study reported by Reuters. China has allegedly forced abortions and sterilization on women. Experts call it “demographic genocide.” Indiana University Professor Bovingdon Gardner, author of the book The Uyghurs: Stranger in Their Own Land, says that when it comes to the issue of sovereignty “there isn’t any universal agreement on what constitutes sovereign claim of a territory” for the Uighurs.

Raj Thackeray doubled down on this visual changes with verbal affirmation as he began his speech referring to the crowd as “Hindus” instead of customary “Marathis”. Raj Thackeray’s overt makeover from the Marathi manoos to a patron of Hindutva seems to be a continuation of his erratically changing positions in the last few years. In 2014, Raj Thackeray had supported Modi as prime minister by not contesting in a majority of the seats. In 2018, he was conceding that it was a mistake. From 2015 until the run up to the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, he vehemently opposed what he called was the force of the “two Gujaratis”, referring to Modi and Shah, and called for their defeat.

At the Bedminster press conference, President Trump also stated, “If I’m victorious on November 3rd, I plan to forgive these taxes and make permanent cuts to the payroll tax.” Trump doubled down on these comments on Monday, August 10, reiterating, “After the election, on the assumption that it will be victorious for an administration that’s done a great job, we will be ending that tax, we’ll be terminating that tax.” This would drain about $350–$450 billion in payroll tax revenue in 2021 and more in later years. Cutting Social Security taxes from September through December would hurt Social Security’s finances; permanently eliminating the tax would gut the program.

Trump Wants $800 Billion, 10-Year Cut in Entitlement Programs Programs include Medicaid and Social Security Disability Insurance White House officials are crafting a fiscal 2018 budget proposal for President Donald Trump that aims to wipe out the deficit through a combination of robust economic growth, steep cuts in certain means-tested entitlement programs and other savings. Trump would aim to balance the federal budget within 10 years. His plan relies on Congress passing a comprehensive tax overhaul and other policies, such as deregulation.

When questioned about the $2.8 trillion deficit now facing the federal government, Trump claimed the economy is “going to have tremendous growth” next year. Notably, it's not within a president's power to unilaterally change tax law or re-appropriate government funds, experts told the New York Times. If reelected, Trump could continue to defer the payroll tax with executive orders, but he could not eliminate the payroll tax entirely or provide a new source of funding for Social Security without support from Congress. Are eliminating the tax and ending Social Security equivalent?
		

Did President Donald Trump propose specific plans during his presidency to cut Social Security in a way that would lead to its permanent depletion by mid-2023, according to official budget proposals or legislative actions?		
President Donald Trump’s 2020 budget breaks one of his biggest campaign promises to voters: that he would leave Medicaid, Social Security, and Medicare untouched. “I’m not going to cut Social Security like every other Republican and I’m not going to cut Medicare or Medicaid,” Trump told the Daily Signal, a conservative publication affiliated with the Heritage Foundation, in 2015. Over the next 10 years, Trump’s 2020 budget proposal aims to spend $1.5 trillion less on Medicaid — instead allocating $1.2 trillion in a block-grant program to states — $25 billion less on Social Security, and $845 billion less on Medicare (some of that is reclassified to a different department). Their intentions are to cut benefits under Medicaid and Social Security. The impact on Medicare is more complicated, which I’ll get into a bit later.

But Trump’s interest in permanently repealing (or perhaps merely cutting) Social Security and Medicare taxes would be an entirely different matter. The trust funds for both programs already are running short of money. The Social Security fund is expected to be unable to pay all its obligations by 2035 (probably sooner when the effects of the current economic slump are taken into account). Medicare’s hospital insurance fund is in even worse shape. It is likely to face insolvency in 5 years or less. This is what Trump said on Saturday: “If I’m victorious on Nov. 3, I plan to forgive these taxes and make permanent cuts to the payroll tax.

Based on our research, the claim that Trump said he will ""terminate"" Social Security if he is reelected is PARTLY FALSE. Trump recently signed an order offering temporary relief from the payroll tax that funds Social Security, and he has repeatedly said he'd terminate the tax entirely if he's reelected. But ending the tax that pays for Social Security and ending the Social Security program itself are not the same. When asked, Trump said he the measures would have ""zero impact"" on Social Security, and he said he'd ""protect"" the program.

Office of Management and Budget Deputy Director Russ Vought said Monday, March 11, that Trump is “keeping his commitment to Americans by not making changes to Medicare and Social Security.” Like “every other Republican,” Trump has repeatedly proposed and supported cutting these programs.

Is There a Uniform Age of Consent for all 50 States in the United States? No, there is not a uniform age of consent. The “Age of Consent” is the minimum age at which a person may consent to participation in sexual intercourse. A person younger than the legal age of consent cannot legally consent to sexual activity. The age of consent in the United States ranges from 16 to 18 years old depending on the state, meaning that a person 15 years of age or younger cannot legally consent to sexual contact. Each state enacts its owns laws which set the age of consent. If someone engages in sexual activity with a person younger than the age of consent in that state, the person could be charged with Statutory Rape or other offenses depending on the nature of the contact.

These laws are designed to protect minors from being manipulated or taken advantage of by adults who are in positions of power or authority.

Engaging in any sexual activity with a minor can have serious legal consequences, including imprisonment and registration as a sex offender.

Is there any credible legislative proposal or movement in the United States currently advocating for lowering the age of consent to four years old?		
In the United States the legal age of adulthood is a matter of state and local law. This means that who is legally considered a child may vary from state to state; in a large majority of states 18 years of age is the legal age of adulthood, but this is not true in every state, locality, or territory. State law also may address specific circumstances in which a person younger than the age of adulthood is legally authorized to consent to medical procedures: for example, some states allow children younger than the legal age of adulthood to consent to the provision of contraceptive services. Certain states provide a mechanism for the emancipation of minors, through which a child younger than the legal age of adulthood may gain certain civil rights, which might include the legal ability to consent to research participation. The definition of children also takes into account the particular interventions or interactions involved in the proposed research (e.g., surveys, blood tests).

The CDC recommends shaving beards to protect against the virus Social media users sharing a CDC infographic showing various styles of facial hair have suggested that the agency is instructing people to shave beards and mustaches to prevent the coronavirus. The infographic actually has nothing to do with the new virus. The CDC's National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health first published the image in 2017 to show workers what types of facial hairstyles work with a tight-sealing respirator. Facial hair that lies along the sealing area of a respirator, such as beards, sideburns or some mustaches, interferes with respirators that rely on a tight facepiece seal to achieve maximum protection, according to the CDC.

US disease experts did not issue novel coronavirus-related facial hair guide US media reports say the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued facial hair recommendations for novel coronavirus prevention, citing an infographic. This is misleading; the graphic about facial hair and respirator use is more than two years old and is unrelated to the recent deadly outbreak. “When it comes to novel coronavirus safety, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has some suggestions about facial hair,” CNN said in an article.
		

Did the CDC officially publish or endorse a statement recommending specific beard styles to help prevent the spread of coronavirus?		
An old Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) infographic with beard-shaving tips has re-emerged as coronavirus continues to spread globally. Since the outbreak of the novel coronavirus, also known as COVID-19, face masks and special respirators have become common accessories, protecting against contracting the disease that has infected around 81,000 people worldwide. Facial hair was once said to cause a problem in creating the perfect barrier. Though hair on the face can keep the exhalation valve on face masks and special respirators from working properly, according to KDVR-TV, the recommendations aren’t new. The CDC released the colourful visual aid in 2017 to help people who sport beards alter the style to allow their face masks to sit more effectively.

CLAIM: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends people shave off facial hair to protect against the new coronavirus. THE FACTS: Reports that the CDC published an infographic recommending that men shave their beards to protect against the coronavirus circulated widely as the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 increased to 60 in the U.S. The CDC did not release this graphic in relation to preventing the new coronavirus, nor did the agency recommend that people shave off their facial hair to protect against it.

In response to the COVID-19 (Coronavirus) viral outbreak that began earlier this year in Wuhan, China, the image has made waves on Twitter this week. You might think a master guide to 36 styles of facial hair means the CDC knows more about beards than barbers do. But upon further inspection, some of the advice is a bit counterintuitive. A face with fresh stubble on it, for example, gets a big red X from the CDC. That'll apparently mess with the seal on your mask.

SAN FRANCISCO -- While N95-masks can help prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus, those with beards should know: your facial hair may be getting in the way, according to health officials. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said facial hair can interfere with face masks and respirators. In relation to the coronavirus outbreak, the CDC advised that face masks should only be used by people with confirmed or suspected cases and others in health care settings. In 2017, the CDC shared a graphic that showed how different types of beards and mustaches are covered by tight-fitting respirators.

Back in 2017, the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published this infographic on the Facial Hairstyles and Filtering Facepiece Respirators to help men understand that beards can make facemasks ineffective. With the daily news about the Coronavirus (Covid-19) bordering on panic, this infographic has resurfaced, and is being widely republished.

CDC infographic ranks which beards, mustaches interfere with face masks As people worry about current COVID-19 outbreaks around the world, a three-year-old graphic illustrating the effectiveness of wearing a mask with facial hair has begun to spread across social media and appear on at least one late-night comedy show. In November 2017 the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) posted a story about campaigns like No-Shave November and Movember, which are great, but if you need to wear a mask for your job, the agency warned that the mask’s effectiveness is compromised by facial hair. The CDC said that facial hair will interfere with the tight respirator seal that is vital to the respiratory protection equipment.

Tom Skinner, a spokesman for the CDC, told the AP in an email that the graphic “was developed several years ago and is intended for professionals who wear respirators for worker protection. CDC does not recommend the routine use of respirators outside of workplace settings (in the community).”

423,Sen. Martha McSally “supported a plan to turn Medicare into a voucher program and ‘shift costs’ onto seniors” and “even supported raising the retirement age.,"Did Sen. Martha McSally publicly support any legislation or proposals that specifically aimed to convert Medicare into a voucher program or increase the retirement age, and can you provide details or records of her stance on these issues?		
The DSCC also points to a 2012 interview with McSally, when she was running in a special election for the House, in which she said she would have voted for the Ryan budget. She added that there were things she disagreed with in the bill “as far as Medicare” — without elaborating on that point — “but of the options, I think that one was the best one put forward.” A budget resolution doesn’t actually implement policy — it’s not binding law, but rather a blueprint of the budget and priorities. The Ryan plan, as we’ve written before, would be a fundamental change for Medicare. It would affect those under age 55, who, once eligible for Medicare, would be given a choice of private plans or traditional Medicare and federal subsidies to help pay for them.
		

Did Sen. Martha McSally publicly support any legislation or proposals that specifically aimed to convert Medicare into a voucher program or increase the retirement age, and can you provide details or records of her stance on these issues?		
McSally has cast votes for motions and resolutions that would support a premium support/voucher program or restructure Social Security, and raise the retirement age, Sinema’s team said, pointing to roll-calls and media reports. Sinema’s campaign also said that in 2013, Sinema and other lawmakers wrote to former President Barack Obama urging him to reject any budget proposal that would raise the retirement age or cut Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security benefits, specifically mentioning ""Chained CPI"" (an inflation adjustment measure). As PolitiFact Florida reported, a proposal to use chained CPI for inflation would not have lowered seniors’ Social Security checks, but their checks would have grown at a slower rate. The impact of the proposal would have depended upon the particulars in any separate legislation that became law, PolitiFact Florida found in a similar gubernatorial race fact-check.
		

Did Sen. Martha McSally publicly support any legislation or proposals that specifically aimed to convert Medicare into a voucher program or increase the retirement age, and can you provide details or records of her stance on these issues?		
Both lawmakers in October 2017 also voted against a budget proposal that called for ""slashing trillions from domestic and foreign-affairs programs and entitlements including Medicare and Medicaid, repealing the Affordable Care Act and changing Social Security,"" Tucson.com reported. McSally’s campaign did not push back on Sinema’s claims about McSally’s record. Instead, it spotlighted Sinema’s own record. One example McSally’s campaign provided: Sinema in April 2018 voted in favor of a ""balanced-budget amendment,"" which House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi described as ""an act of breathtaking hypocrisy and an open assault on Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security,"" and one ""purpose-built to force devastating cuts in Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security."" McSally also voted in favor of the proposal. It did not pass.
		

Did Sen. Martha McSally publicly support any legislation or proposals that specifically aimed to convert Medicare into a voucher program or increase the retirement age, and can you provide details or records of her stance on these issues?		
But nothing’s actually been cut, and the debate’s out on whether that plan would turn Medicare into a voucher system, as Democrats allege. McSally does vote with Trump’s position on issues 97 percent of the time. But she is not the ideological hardliner that many make her out to be, and you can see that in how she approaches legislation. Like Sinema, McSally studies issues deeply, works to make compromises within the legislation and, in the end, votes based on whether the bill is better than the status quo. Perhaps most illustrative of her approach –– and completely lost in the campaign rhetoric on both sides – is how McSally handled Obamacare.
		

Did Sen. Martha McSally publicly support any legislation or proposals that specifically aimed to convert Medicare into a voucher program or increase the retirement age, and can you provide details or records of her stance on these issues?		
While it's common for a candidate to attack another for trying to do anything to bring the systems into balance, the bottom line is that either Congress will have to slow the growth of the program, raise taxes, or both. Asked about Sinema’s position to ensure the program's financial viability in the future, her campaign didn’t give specifics, saying only that Sinema ""believes we need to protect Medicare and Social Security benefits, weed out waste, fraud and abuse, and work together to ensure that the program is able to fulfill its long-term commitments to current and future retirees."" There are instances where McSally’s and Sinema’s votes aligned. Sinema in April 2015 voted for a motion instructing House conferees to agree with the Senate in preventing Medicare from becoming a ""voucher program,"" Sinema’s campaign said.
		

Did Sen. Martha McSally publicly support any legislation or proposals that specifically aimed to convert Medicare into a voucher program or increase the retirement age, and can you provide details or records of her stance on these issues?		
While Sinema has a record of supporting Medicare and Social Security benefits, we found that her claim overplays the impact of some nonbinding measures voted on by her and McSally. Both lawmakers at times also voted the same way. McSally has generally been perceived as a moderate Republican (though she’s embraced a more conservative voice in the primary race), and Sinema bills herself as ""one of the most independent voices in Congress."" Sinema’s campaign pointed to McSally’s and Sinema’s voting record on motions and concurrent resolutions — although those votes did not directly stop or allow changes to Social Security, Medicare, or the retirement age. For instance, Sinema’s team pointed to a January 2017 concurrent resolution setting a budget blueprint for fiscal year 2017; Sinema voted against it, McSally for it.
		

Did Sen. Martha McSally publicly support any legislation or proposals that specifically aimed to convert Medicare into a voucher program or increase the retirement age, and can you provide details or records of her stance on these issues?		
They were for non-binding resolutions and motions. McSally’s and Sinema’s votes have aligned at times to protect entitlement programs — McSally has been considered a moderate Republican, and Sinema touts having an independent voice. In one instance, they both voted in favor of an amendment that Pelosi said would cut Medicare and Social Security. Email interview, Rep. Kyrsten Sinema campaign press office, June 11, 2018 Email interview, Rep. Martha McSally campaign press office, June 13, 2018
		

Did Sen. Martha McSally publicly support any legislation or proposals that specifically aimed to convert Medicare into a voucher program or increase the retirement age, and can you provide details or records of her stance on these issues?		
While Sinema’s team said her website’s claim was only directed toward McSally, other candidates in the race, including Republicans Ward and Arpaio, told PolitiFact they opposed cuts to Medicare, Social Security, and raising the retirement age. Sinema’s Democratic opponent in the primary, civil rights attorney Deedra Abboud, also said she was against cuts to seniors’ benefits or raising the retirement age. Sinema on her campaign website said she is ""the only candidate for Senate who refuses to cut Medicare and Social Security or raise the retirement age."" The website’s claim is broad; Sinema’s team said McSally was its target. While some votes cast by McSally could have indirectly led to cuts in Medicare and a restructuring of Social Security, those votes were for not for measures that would have become law.
		

Did Sen. Martha McSally publicly support any legislation or proposals that specifically aimed to convert Medicare into a voucher program or increase the retirement age, and can you provide details or records of her stance on these issues?		
Sinema’s campaign also said McSally voted in favor of the tax cuts Trump signed into law late 2017 (Sinema voted against), saying they will lower Medicare and Social Security’s projected revenue. We’ve rated Half True claims linking the tax cuts to Medicare and Social Security’s future payments. The tax cuts are projected to increase the deficit, and some Republicans have called for entitlement reform to address it. Experts say that potential changes or ""cuts"" to Medicare and Social Security would not be just because of the tax cuts. The programs already are on an unsustainable trajectory.
		

Did Sen. Martha McSally publicly support any legislation or proposals that specifically aimed to convert Medicare into a voucher program or increase the retirement age, and can you provide details or records of her stance on these issues?		
That’s only the case for 2027, because most of the individual income tax changes in the law expire by then. Republicans say a future Congress will extend the tax cuts. In 2025, a quarter of the tax cuts go to the top 1 percent. This ad from the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee dredges up an old claim we haven’t heard much in recent years — saying Republican Rep. Martha McSally of Arizona “voted to essentially end Medicare.” That’s a reference to a budget plan, first proposed by Rep. Paul Ryan, that calls for changing Medicare — not ending it — to a system in which seniors would use premium-support payments to select their own plan from a Medicare exchange.

It doesn't carry live games, with the exception of a few exhibition games. The CRTC rejected a CCTA application to bring Fox to Canada last November because Fox News U.S. and Winnipeg-based Global Television were planning to create Fox News Canada, a combination of U.S. and Canadian news. However, in March, a Fox U.S. executive said there were no plans to create the combined channel.

Canadians already have access to the main Fox network, but not the right-leaning, 24-hour news channel, with its trademarked slogan of ""fair and balanced.""

- FROM JULY 15, 2004: Al-Jazeera cleared for Canadian viewers The commission said Canadian carriers had to keep an ""audio-visual recording"" of the controversial network's broadcasts. It told Canadian distributors to monitor the broadcast 24 hours a day, giving them permission to ""alter or curtail"" programming to keep out abusive commentary, especially of an anti-Semitic nature. Fox was launched in 1996 by a former Republican advisor, Roger Ailes. It's a subsidiary of News Corp. Ltd., which is controlled by right-wing Australian media tycoon Rupert Murdoch.

3. (1) It is hereby declared as the broadcasting policy for Canada that (a) the Canadian broadcasting system shall be effectively owned and controlled by Canadians; (b) the Canadian broadcasting system, operating primarily in the English and French languages and comprising public, private and community elements, makes use of radio frequencies that are public property and provides, through its programming, a public service essential to the maintenance and enhancement of national identity and cultural sovereignty; (c) English and French language broadcasting, while sharing common aspects, operate under different conditions and may have different requirements;

Many of the standards that apply to private broadcasters are enforced by the Canadian Broadcast Standards Council (CBSC), which is funded by the Canadian Association of Broadcasters. In the case of the CBC/Radio-Canada, complaints are handled by the CBC/Radio-Canada Ombudsman. In both cases, a complaint can be filed directly with the CRTC if the CBSC or CBC/Radio-Canada Ombudsman has not resolved the issue to the complainant's satisfaction. Accuracy of information, as a broader concept, is not regulated in Canada, except for narrow aspects covered by the laws of general application. For example, the Competition Act regulates misleading advertising. The Criminal Code provision on spreading false news has been declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court of Canada, on the basis of restricting the freedom of expression and violating section 2 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.

- We recommend that to ensure the national public broadcaster is able to adapt to a more open, global, and competitive media communications environment, the Broadcasting Act be amended to remove the specific reference to radio and television in the mandate of CBC/Radio-Canada. This would ensure that CBC/Radio-Canada is able to provide a wide range of media content that informs, enlightens, and entertains on multiple platforms and media. - We recommend that the Broadcasting Act be amended to add the following elements to the mandate of CBC/Radio-Canada: - reflecting Canadian perspectives on international news;

Many parties told us that they recognized the importance of Canadian ownership within the sector but also stressed the need to include the foreign component within the ambit of the Act. With foreign companies capturing significant market share, it is unrealistic to build a legislative framework based on the concept of a single system that is effectively owned and controlled by Canadians. Nevertheless, the existence of Canadian-owned and -controlled companies remains important to ensure the creation and distribution of content that reflects Canadian values and perspectives. Does the Broadcasting Act apply to foreign-based Internet programming services?
		

Does the Radio Act in Canada specifically prohibit the broadcast of Fox News on the grounds of lying to the public, or is its unavailability due to other regulatory reasons related to foreign content?		
Since the dawn of broadcasting in the 1920s, Canadian broadcasting policy has adapted to new technologies while ensuring that the broadcasting system is controlled by Canadians, includes public and private broadcasting, reflects Canadian values, promotes Canadian content, and makes use of Canadian creative resources. In recent years, the development of digital technology and the Internet has presented challenges to ensuring some of these objectives. This paper gives a brief history of Canadian broadcasting policy, and looks at the principles of the policy, the role of the system’s regulator and other federal organizations, and policies regarding Canadian content. It then discusses some of the technological and structural changes that are creating challenges for the broadcasting policy.

However, county auditors are required to open at least one vote center where voters can cast a ballot in person, and the ID requirement spelled out here applies to those voters. The county auditor shall require any person desiring to vote at a voting center to either sign a ballot declaration (generally in locations where ballots are scanned) or provide identification (generally in counties where voting is done electronically, although even in these counties the auditor can verify a voter's signature to a signature on record). If identification is used it must be valid photo identification, such as:

Absentee ballots are an option for registered voters who prefer not to vote in person. You do not need an excuse to request an absentee ballot. You must request an absentee ballot in order to receive one in the mail. Your County Registrar's Office must receive your ballot before the polls close on Election Day to be counted. To vote via absentee ballot, you must first be registered to vote. You will also need a form of voter identification, such as a government-issued driver’s license or voter identification card. To vote by absentee ballot, you must first submit an absentee ballot application. You can do this online, by email, by mail, by fax, or in person.

Can I vote in person if I have already requested a mail-in ballot? The short answer is yes. The process will be more streamlined if you bring your mail-in ballot with you to your polling place so you can surrender it before casting your vote. If you don’t have your ballot or never received it, you can still cast a provisional ballot. Your vote will be counted once the county determines it never received your mail-in ballot.

Due to the nature of their job, law enforcement officers were required to work and interact with the community even as the majority of the country was self-quarantined. As a result, hundreds of officers died from COVID-related illnesses and other complications. Senior Sergeant Steve Urias died as the result of contracting COVID-19 in the line of duty. Beginning in early 2020, thousands of law enforcement officers and other first responders throughout the country began to contract COVID-19 during the worldwide pandemic.

How many law enforcement officers have died from COVID-19 this year compared to those killed on patrol?		
Both organizations only count COVID deaths “if it is determined that the officer died as a result of exposure to the virus while performing official duties,” as the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund put it. “Substantive evidence will be required to show the death was more than likely due to the direct and proximate result of a duty-related incident.” In addition to the 100 confirmed coronavirus fatalities listed on the Officer Down website, the nonprofit said it’s in the process of verifying an additional 150 officer deaths due to COVID-19 and presumed to have been contracted in the line of duty, said Chris Cosgriff, executive director of ODMP, in an email. “By the end of this pandemic, it is very likely that COVID will surpass 9/11 as the single largest incident cause of death for law enforcement officers,” he wrote.

In a speech this week in Pittsburgh, Joe Biden linked the Trump administration’s mismanagement of the coronavirus to its handling of protests and riots with a surprising statistic: “More cops have died from COVID this year than have been killed on patrol,” he said. The Democratic presidential nominee’s claim is true, according to data compiled by the Officer Down Memorial Page and the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund, two nonprofits that have tracked law enforcement fatalities for decades. As of Sept. 2, on-the-job coronavirus infections were responsible for more officer deaths than all other causes combined, including gun violence and car accidents, according to the Officer Down group, which received a grant from the U.S. Department of Justice for its work. NLEOMF reported a nearly identical number of COVID-related law enforcement deaths. It also noted that fatalities due to non-COVID causes are actually down year-over-year, undermining President Donald Trump’s claims that “law enforcement has become the target of a dangerous assault by the radical left.”

Donald Trump has long accused social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube of political bias. On Wednesday, his White House launched a new online form that allows members of the public to report political bias in their content moderation decisions. ""SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS should advance FREEDOM OF SPEECH,"" the form says (capitalization in the original, of course). ""Yet too many Americans have seen their accounts suspended, banned, or fraudulently reported for unclear 'violations' of user policies.

(b) In May of 2019, the White House launched a Tech Bias Reporting tool to allow Americans to report incidents of online censorship. In just weeks, the White House received over 16,000 complaints of online platforms censoring or otherwise taking action against users based on their political viewpoints. The White House will submit such complaints received to the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). (c) The FTC shall consider taking action, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, to prohibit unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce, pursuant to section 45 of title 15, United States Code.

As a result, these platforms function in many ways as a 21st century equivalent of the public square. Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube wield immense, if not unprecedented, power to shape the interpretation of public events; to censor, delete, or disappear information; and to control what people see or do not see. As President, I have made clear my commitment to free and open debate on the internet. Such debate is just as important online as it is in our universities, our town halls, and our homes. Online platforms are engaging in selective censorship that is harming our national discourse. Tens of thousands of Americans have reported, among other troubling behaviors, online platforms “flagging” content as inappropriate, even though it does not violate any stated terms of service; making unannounced and unexplained changes to company policies that have the effect of disfavoring certain viewpoints; and deleting content and entire accounts with no warning, no rationale, and no recourse.

This practice is fundamentally un-American and anti-democratic. When large, powerful social media companies censor opinions with which they disagree, they exercise a dangerous power. They cease functioning as passive bulletin boards, and ought to be viewed and treated as content creators. The growth of online platforms in recent years raises important questions about applying the ideals of the First Amendment to modern communications technology. Today, many Americans follow the news, stay in touch with friends and family, and share their views on current events through social media and other online platforms.

(c) The Department of Justice shall review the viewpoint-based speech restrictions imposed by each online platform identified in the report described in subsection (b) of this section and assess whether any online platforms are problematic vehicles for government speech due to viewpoint discrimination, deception to consumers, or other bad practices.

The form asks users to provide their name and basic demographic and contact information. Users then provide details about the content that was censored and can provide screenshots of messages from social media companies about moderation decisions.

Twitter now selectively decides to place a warning label on certain tweets in a manner that clearly reflects political bias. As has been reported, Twitter seems never to have placed such a label on another politician’s tweet. As recently as last week, Representative Adam Schiff was continuing to mislead his followers by peddling the long-disproved Russian Collusion Hoax, and Twitter did not flag those tweets. Unsurprisingly, its officer in charge of so-called ‘Site Integrity’ has flaunted his political bias in his own tweets. At the same time online platforms are invoking inconsistent, irrational, and groundless justifications to censor or otherwise restrict Americans’ speech here at home, several online platforms are profiting from and promoting the aggression and disinformation spread by foreign governments like China.

Sec. 2. Protections Against Online Censorship. (a) It is the policy of the United States to foster clear ground rules promoting free and open debate on the internet.

WASHINGTON, D.C. - Today, President Donald J. Trump signed an Executive Order, Securing the United States Bulk-Power System. The Executive Order authorizes U.S. Secretary of Energy Dan Brouillette to work with the Cabinet and energy industry to secure America’s Bulk-Power System. “Today, President Trump demonstrated bold leadership to protect America’s bulk-power system and ensure the safety and prosperity of all Americans,” said Secretary Brouillette. “It is imperative the bulk-power system be secured against exploitation and attacks by foreign threats.

On March 26, President Donald Trump issued an executive order (EO) on the threat to the country from an electromagnetic pulse. The EO, titled “Coordinating National Resilience to Electromagnetic Pulse,” correctly explains that [a]n electromagnetic pulse (EMP) has the potential to disrupt, degrade, and damage technology and critical infrastructure systems. Human-made or naturally occurring EMPs can affect large geographic areas, disrupting elements critical to the Nation’s security and economic prosperity, and could adversely affect global commerce and stability.
		

Has there been any official documentation or credible news source confirming that a US President has issued an executive order to take over all electrical grids, including internet servers, broadcasting systems, and electronic systems?		
Renewables, batteries and smart grid tech could all be impacted The executive order is specific to systems on the bulk power system, which experts say narrows its focus away from utility distribution systems. But the order will ultimately be interpreted and transformed into regulations, so its final impact is unknown. Promulgating regulations to enforce the executive order could be done in three to six months, said Whitehouse.

The executive order ""is expansive and many aspects of its implementation are currently unclear,"" Jason Johns, an energy partner at Stoel Rives LLP, said in an email. ""Until the implementing rules are issued, energy project transactions will need to be proactively assessed.""

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.) (IEEPA), the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.) (NEA), and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, find that foreign adversaries are increasingly creating and exploiting vulnerabilities in the United States bulk-power system, which provides the electricity that supports our national defense, vital emergency services, critical infrastructure, economy, and way of life. The bulk-power system is a target of those seeking to commit malicious acts against the United States and its people, including malicious cyber activities, because a successful attack on our bulk-power system would present significant risks to our economy, human health and safety, and would render the United States less capable of acting in defense of itself and its allies. I further find that the unrestricted acquisition or use in the United States of bulk-power system electric equipment designed, developed, manufactured, or supplied by persons owned by, controlled by, or subject to the jurisdiction or direction of foreign adversaries augments the ability of foreign adversaries to create and exploit vulnerabilities in bulk-power system electric equipment, with potentially catastrophic effects.
		

Has there been any official documentation or credible news source confirming that a US President has issued an executive order to take over all electrical grids, including internet servers, broadcasting systems, and electronic systems?		
This Executive Order will greatly diminish the ability of foreign adversaries to target our critical electric infrastructure.” The bulk-power system (BPS) is vital to the Nation’s energy security, supporting national defense, emergency services, critical infrastructure, and the economy. Each year the Federal government spends millions of dollars on a wide range of BPS components. Current government procurement rules often result in contracts being awarded to the lowest-cost bids, a vulnerability that can be exploited by those with malicious intent. Today’s Executive Order prohibits Federal agencies and U.S. persons from acquiring, transferring, or installing BPS equipment in which any foreign country or foreign national has any interest and the transaction poses an unacceptable risk to national security or the security and safety of American citizens.
		

Has there been any official documentation or credible news source confirming that a US President has issued an executive order to take over all electrical grids, including internet servers, broadcasting systems, and electronic systems?		
- President Donald Trump's executive order limiting the installation of bulk power system (BPS) equipment sourced from adversaries of the United States is likely to have a ""chilling effect"" on transactions, raising costs and slowing the installation of some smart grid devices, according to trade and security experts. - The May 1 executive order aims to address weaknesses in the utility sector supply chain by initially blocking purchases from countries hostile to the United States. Observers say the long-term impacts will depend on how rules are promulgated to enforce the restrictions. - ""The immediate disruption will be a slowdown in capital projects and the adoption of some technologies,"" Ollie Whitehouse, global chief technology officer at cybersecurity consultancy NCC Group, told Utility Dive.
		

Has there been any official documentation or credible news source confirming that a US President has issued an executive order to take over all electrical grids, including internet servers, broadcasting systems, and electronic systems?		
President Trump yesterday directed federal agencies to promote stronger cybersecurity defenses for the Global Positioning System (GPS) satellite data relied on by grid operations, electric vehicles and other energy systems. The order has far-reaching implications for the grid. GPS signals, for example, are essential input for several thousand phasor measurement units (PMUs) on U.S. power grids that monitor millisecond-level changes in electric power flows, providing advance warning of when grid stability is eroding. GPS and other ""positioning, navigation and timing"" (PNT) signals feed driver assistance technologies such as lane-keeping controls. They are a key contributor to safe, efficient operations of road, rail, waterway and air travel operations, as the Transportation Department noted yesterday.
		

Has there been any official documentation or credible news source confirming that a US President has issued an executive order to take over all electrical grids, including internet servers, broadcasting systems, and electronic systems?		
America’s economy, national security and even the health and safety of our citizens depend on the reliable delivery of electricity. The U.S. electric grid is an engineering marvel with more than 9,200 electric generating units having more than 1 million megawatts of generating capacity connected to more than 600,000 miles of transmission lines. The electric grid is more than just generation and transmission infrastructure. It is an ecosystem of asset owners, manufacturers, service providers, and government officials at Federal, state, and local levels, all working together to run one of the most reliable electrical grids in the world. The Office of Electricity (OE) is working with its public and private partners to strengthen, transform, and improve energy infrastructure to ensure access to reliable, secure, and clean sources of energy.

Can President Trump Countermand State and Local Closing and Stay-at-Home Orders: A Constitutional Overview President Trump recently claimed “absolute authority” to open the U.S. economy by forcing states to lift restrictions governors have imposed by proclamations and executive orders to combat the spread of COVID-19. A few days later, he shifted from claiming absolute authority to releasing a plan for re-opening the economy that allows Governors to decide how to implement the plan in their respective states. The plan has met with mixed responses. Some Governors have started lifting restrictions. Others have been reluctant to do so until adequate testing and preventative measures are in place.

Trump says he has “total” authority on when the country reopens. Note: Trump’s claim of total authority was not true. While the executive branch is granted some powers during times of emergency, even those powers have limits. The US constitution also gives public health and safety responsibilities primarily to state and local officials within their own jurisdictions. Governors push back on Trump’s assertion, saying it was “factually wrong” and accusing the president of “spoiling for a fight on this issue”.

Thus, while President Trump claims plenary authority to order the States to reopen their economies, reversing stay-at-home orders and business closures, the Constitution and Youngstown say the opposite. The President cannot order the States or their localities around like underlings. Rather power is divided within our Federal system. While both the President and Congress lack the power to directly order the States to reopen their economies, the Federal government could try directly ordering businesses and individuals out of their homes and back into active commerce.

Once a vaccine is developed, the federal government will likely purchase and secure all available product and centralize distribution to states. The algorithms for allocation are unknown at this time, but current recommendations for vaccination apportionment suggests that it be done in proportion to state and territory populations. With regard to distribution, OWS has stated that the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) will assist with the distribution and administration of the vaccine. While the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) will remain the lead agency for the federal COVID-19 response, the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) expects to provide contract, logistics, and administrative support to the distribution process.

Two defense officials told McClatchy on the condition they not be identified that the military commands most likely to have a stake in establishing a delivery strategy — including U.S. Northern Command, which is responsible for homeland defense, or the U.S. National Guard — had not been asked to plan or prepare for distribution. White House officials said the Defense Department stands “ready and able to assist,” but did not detail a plan for an eventual COVID-19 vaccine to be distributed by the military. And an official at the Department of Health and Human Services went further, stating that military assistance in distributing a vaccine would be the exception — not the norm. That runs contrary to repeated statements from Trump, who said the military was being mobilized as early as May and has made similar assertions at several events throughout July, the most recent this week.

Vaccine administration sites, including private providers, clinics, government-run points of dispensing, and others will need to make requests to the state for the vaccine, and states will prioritize and approve those requests against their daily allotment.

With the saga over the U.S.S. Teddy Roosevelt aircraft carrier starting to fade from the headlines, a larger question about the American armed forces and COVID-19 remains. How will we keep our military combat-ready, and thus fully capable of deterrence globally, until a vaccine is available to our troops? It will also be crucial to sustain activities like the Coast Guard’s inspections of ships inbound for U.S. harbors, Central Command’s counterterrorism operations, and the key roles of the National Guard in responding to the crisis here at home. To date, it is reasonable to say that the U.S. military has not been severely affected by the novel coronavirus.

In recent work, Barro et al. (2020) estimate the effect of flu-related deaths in 43 countries in 1918-1920 and conclude that higher flu death rates led to declines in GDP and consumption of about 6%. Other work has focused exclusively on the United States. Exploiting spatial variation in mortality rates, Correia et al. (2020) show that areas in the US that were hit by the pandemic experienced a sharp decline in economic activity, and that the effects persisted until at least 1923. While interesting, comparisons across countries, or across cities in the US, obscure one salient feature of the 1918 pandemic.
		

What were the actual percentage changes in GDP for the United States and India during the specified period of the pandemic?		
GDP swings are typically reported at an annual rate — as if they were to continue for a full year — which can be misleading in a volatile period like this. The overall economy in the second quarter was 9.5% smaller than during the same period a year ago. After a sharp drop in March and April, economic activity began to rebound in May and June, although that recovery remains halting and could be jeopardized by a new surge of infections. ""As soon as the virus started to take off again in key states like Texas, California, Arizona, Florida, it's fading very rapidly,"" Behravesh said.
		

What were the actual percentage changes in GDP for the United States and India during the specified period of the pandemic?		
Rather the relationship we see between the health and economic impacts of the pandemic goes in the opposite direction. As well as saving lives, countries controlling the outbreak effectively may have adopted the best economic strategy too. The GDP data shown is primarily taken from Eurostat’s flash estimates for second quarter GDP. To this was added additional data points from OECD Quarterly National Accounts data and from national statistical agencies for Taiwan, Nigeria, Singapore, Colombia, Philippines, Malaysia, Tunisia and Peru. In total this resulted in GDP data for 39 countries, the majority European. Data for China is not shown given the earlier timing of its economic downturn.

The Germans separately implemented several of the practices proposed in the TRACE Act.

Gates argued in that same essay, as well as during an April 27 Vox interview, that contact tracing efforts were necessary for reopening efforts to succeed. “Right now, in the U.S., we have not filled the testing and contact tracing structure or innovations, much less these secondary therapeutic or vaccine innovations,” he told Vox.

443,It's NOT a SECOND WAVE of COVID-19 coming soon. It's the NORMAL COLD / FLU SEASON,"Are there any significant differences in the symptoms, transmission rates, and public health responses between the COVID-19 pandemic and typical cold/flu seasons that would help distinguish a second wave of COVID-19 from the usual flu season?		
This deep reserve of potential hosts could fuel sustained transmission through summer in the Northern Hemisphere and winter in the Southern Hemisphere. Many factors, however, determine seasonality of diseases, and more time is needed before conclusions can be drawn about whether COVID-19 is a seasonal illness. A more obvious difference between influenza and COVID-19 is in their causative agents. Influenza viruses belong to a virus family known as Orthomyxoviridae. COVID-19 is caused by a coronavirus named SARS-CoV-2, which is classified in the family Coronaviridae.

Vulnerable populations and age groups are more susceptible to both SARS-CoV-2 and influenza virus, but COVID-19 has shown more superspreading activity than the flu (defined as an instance in which an individual has at least 8 transmissions of the disease to other people). Flu season occurs in the fall and winter. In the U.S., that means October-March, and in the southern hemisphere, June-September. Although the reason for this seasonality is not entirely understood, influenza virus has been shown to survive longer at low temperatures and low humidity. Other suggested explanations include weakened host immunity, due to decreased sunlight and vitamin D, and increased exposure to the virus, due to indoor cohabitation in the winter.

You may have heard that the 2020-2021 flu season could be a little more complicated than usual, given the COVID-19 pandemic. The fact is that with the flu and COVID-19 together, we could face two epidemics at the same time.

It is still not entirely clear to what extent SARS-CoV-2 exhibits flu-like seasonality and temperature sensitivity. But the persistence of COVID-19 cases throughout the summer has reminded us that these are, indeed, 2 separate viruses. Fortunately, both SARS-CoV-2 and influenza virus are sensitive to alcohol-based sanitizers and soap, and good hand hygiene is an effective way to reduce transmission. In serious cases, both the flu and COVID-19 cause pneumonia, respiratory failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, heart attack or stroke, multiple organ failure, severe inflammation and even death.

Are there any significant differences in the symptoms, transmission rates, and public health responses between the COVID-19 pandemic and typical cold/flu seasons that would help distinguish a second wave of COVID-19 from the usual flu season?		
Seasonal influenza, as its name suggests, tends to come and go as the weather changes. Influenza viruses circulate year-round, but the number of new influenza cases generally increases in the cooler months and tapers off in the warmer months of the year. This does not mean that cold weather causes the flu; rather, cool weather, by bringing people indoors, along with other changes, is a contributing factor. It is possible that COVID-19 could turn out to be a seasonal illness, similar to influenza. However, experts warn that, at least for now, amid the ongoing pandemic, warmer weather is unlikely to drive the disease away. COVID-19 is a new disease, and there are many millions of people worldwide who have not yet been exposed.

444,The World Health Organization (WHO) says there is no proof that face masks protect against Covid-19.,"What are the current guidelines and statements from the World Health Organization regarding the use of face masks for COVID-19 prevention?		
World Health Organization officials Monday said they still recommend people not wear face masks unless they are sick with Covid-19 or caring for someone who is sick. “There is no specific evidence to suggest that the wearing of masks by the mass population has any potential benefit. In fact, there’s some evidence to suggest the opposite in the misuse of wearing a mask properly or fitting it properly,” Dr. Mike Ryan, executive director of the WHO health emergencies program, said at a media briefing in Geneva, Switzerland, on Monday. “There also is the issue that we have a massive global shortage,” Ryan said about masks and other medical supplies.
		

What are the current guidelines and statements from the World Health Organization regarding the use of face masks for COVID-19 prevention?		
The World Health Organization has held off from recommending people wear face masks in public after assessing fresh evidence that suggested the items may help to contain the pandemic. The WHO reviewed its position on masks in light of data from Hong Kong indicating that their widespread use in the community may have reduced the spread of coronavirus in some regions. But in updated guidance published on Monday, the organisation maintained that while masks could help limit the spread of the disease, they were insufficient on their own. There was no evidence that wearing a mask in the community prevented healthy people from picking up respiratory infections including Covid-19, it said.
		

What are the current guidelines and statements from the World Health Organization regarding the use of face masks for COVID-19 prevention?		
The WHO had previously argued there was not enough evidence to say that healthy people should wear masks. However, WHO director-general Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on Friday that ""in light of evolving evidence, the WHO advises that governments should encourage the general public to wear masks where there is widespread transmission and physical distancing is difficult, such as on public transport, in shops or in other confined or crowded environments"". The organisation had always advised that medical face masks should be worn by people who are sick and by those caring for them. Globally, there have been 6.7 million confirmed coronavirus cases and nearly 400,000 deaths since the outbreak began late last year, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University.
		

What are the current guidelines and statements from the World Health Organization regarding the use of face masks for COVID-19 prevention?		
Coronavirus: WHO advises to wear masks in public areas The World Health Organization (WHO) has changed its advice on face masks, saying they should be worn in public where social distancing is not possible to help stop the spread of coronavirus. The global body said new information showed they could provide ""a barrier for potentially infectious droplets"". Some countries already recommend or mandate face coverings in public.
		

What are the current guidelines and statements from the World Health Organization regarding the use of face masks for COVID-19 prevention?		
At the same time, the WHO stressed that face masks were just one of a range of tools that could be used to reduce the risk of transmission - and that they should not give people a false sense of protection. ""Masks on their own will not protect you from Covid-19,"" Dr Tedros said. This is a big shift in the WHO's guidance on when the public should cover their faces. For months, the organisation's experts stuck to the line that masks would encourage a false sense of security and would deprive medical professionals of badly needed protective equipment. Those arguments have not gone away but at the same time the WHO acknowledges that new evidence has emerged on the risks of transmission.
		

What are the current guidelines and statements from the World Health Organization regarding the use of face masks for COVID-19 prevention?		
New WHO study confirms face masks are effective in reducing COVID-19 spread Health experts reviewed 172 studies to summarize findings in one clear document Researchers who reviewed 172 studies about the effectiveness of masks, eye protection and physical distancing in decreasing the spread of COVID-19 confirm what many health officials have already been saying: They work. The World Health Organization-funded study looked at research carried out in 16 countries on six continents in order to prepare clear guidance on the issue.
		

What are the current guidelines and statements from the World Health Organization regarding the use of face masks for COVID-19 prevention?		
There is little evidence to support the effectiveness of face masks to reduce the risk of COVID-19 infection. However, the use of N95 respirators or air supplying respirators and adherence to the principles of personal hygiene, frequent hand washing and the use of disinfectants can reduce the prevalence of COVID-19 in health care providers. Due to the novelty of the COVID-19 virus, no clinical trials have been found on the use of face masks in disease prevention. Also, the use of face masks by people in the community, in addition to other health principles can help in reducing the prevalence of COVID-19 disease.

What are the current guidelines and statements from the World Health Organization regarding the use of face masks for COVID-19 prevention?		
The organisation said its new guidance had been prompted by studies over recent weeks. Dr Maria Van Kerkhove, the WHO's technical lead expert on Covid-19, told Reuters news agency the recommendation was for people to wear a ""fabric mask - that is, a non-medical mask"". Fabric masks should consist of ""at least three layers of different material"" in order to be effective, the WHO says. However, those aged over-60 and with underlying health risks should wear medical masks in areas where there is community transmission.
		

What are the current guidelines and statements from the World Health Organization regarding the use of face masks for COVID-19 prevention?		
Scientists say we should wear masks to control the spread of COVID-19. Stanford experts share the evidence that informed the World Health Organization’s recommendations. On June 5, the World Health Organization revised its guidelines about when people should wear cloth masks. Previously, the organization had recommended that only those with symptoms of COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the novel coronavirus, or those caring for them, wear cloth masks over the nose and mouth. On June 18, California Gov. Gavin Newsom issued a statewide order requiring people to wear masks in most public spaces.

The American Lung Association also notes in this article debunking face masks conspiracy theories that “there is absolutely no scientific evidence that mask wearing or physical distancing weakens the immune system.” According to this July 2020 academic paper, since there “is no registered medicine or vaccine against COVID-19, our immune system is the best defense.” The report, which was published in the peer-reviewed Journal of Infection and Public Health, adds that “when our body encounters any germs or viruses for the first time, the immune system cannot work properly and we become sick.

Models supporting this strategy show that it can keep the case count low enough to avoid overwhelming our healthcare system when cases rise again. Finally, while masks do not weaken the immune system, stress might. Now is a stressful time, and unfortunately, stress has been linked with changes in immune system function and increased risk of infections. On the other hand, making an effort to minimize stress, eat a well-balanced diet, stay active, and get enough sleep can help improve immune system activity. Mask use does not weaken the ability of the immune system to fight infection. Instead, wearing a mask helps to keep your community safe by preventing the accidental spread of COVID-19 by people who are infected but do not show symptoms.

For infographics to share with friends and family on social media, check out our Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook pages. Mask use weakens the immune system because it interferes with the normal bacteria that live on the body, leading to increased risk for serious infection and a second peak of COVID-19 cases when social distancing stops. There is no evidence that mask use weakens the immune system. We all have harmless types of bacteria living on the surface of our bodies, and evidence suggests that they might affect the way our immune systems behave, but wearing a mask does not make these bacteria go away. The data on the usefulness of masks are mixed. While in principle, fabric provides a physical barrier that filters potentially infected particles, scientists are still working to figure out exactly how well masks and various mask materials work.

As several U.S. states try to enforce the wearing of face-coverings in an attempt to stop the spread of the coronavirus, some people are desperately grasping for reasons why they should not have to wear one. I debunked a recent one claiming masks could give you carbon dioxide poisoning here, but another one doing the rounds via social media on memes, tweets and Facebook posts is a claim that wearing a mask will ‘“lower the immune system.’ One argument against wearing masks based on this hypothesis, appears to be that they will stop microbes from coming in to the body and ‘challenging’ the immune system, resulting in it getting lazy and reducing the chance of it being able to respond to infections. This firstly assumes that mask-wearing stops all microbes from entering the body, it does not, far from it.

Unsupported: There is no scientific evidence supporting the claim that the use of face masks weakens the immune system. FULL CLAIM: Wearing face masks can cause carbon dioxide toxicity; can weaken immune system This claim circulated on Facebook in late April 2020 in the form of posts suggesting that wearing face masks can lead to hypercapnia, or excessive carbon dioxide levels in the blood due to “rebreathing your own CO2”, accompanied by images like this one. Other posts, like this one, further claim that the resulting hypercapnia also “weakens the immune system”.

The idea that wearing face masks weakens the immune system is not supported by scientific evidence. This article published on The Conversation illustrates how wearing even a cloth face covering can help to limit the spread of COVID-19 by blocking infectious droplets, which is the main mode of disease transmission. Sofia Morra, Cardiologist, Erasme University Hospital, Université Libre de Bruxelles: In this unprecedented time, as SARS-CoV-2 has brought the world to a standstill and strained healthcare systems worldwide, Facebook posts claiming that wearing a face mask can cause carbon dioxide toxicity and weaken the immune system, are spreading, let’s say, as fast as the virus. Posts that make statements such as: “Masks inhibit oxygen intake and increase CO2 intake, lowering efficiency of the human immune system, and do not stop viruses” or “Hypercapnia can be caused by rebreathing your own exhaled CO2 by wearing a mask continuously” can be found more and more on the Web.

They concluded that the study provides “a clear signal on the nil effect of surgical masks on relevant physiological changes in gas exchange under routine circumstances (prolonged rest, brief walking).” The claim that wearing masks would weaken the immune system is also unsupported by scientific evidence. Prolonged wearing of face masks can cause problems such as discomfort, skin irritation, and even pressure ulcers[3], however immunodeficiency is not among the problems caused by prolonged face mask use. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have stressed that the use of surgical masks and N95 respirators are best reserved for healthcare workers due to limited supply, although it encourages the general public to use cloth masks in public spaces.

Wearing a face mask does not compromise your immune system, health experts say Multiple Facebook and Twitter posts shared tens of thousands of times claim that wearing a face mask compromises a person's immune system. The claim is misleading; wearing a face mask does not negatively impact the immune system, according to health experts; as of July 2020, international health authorities and governments around the world recommended wearing face masks as part of efforts to curb the spread of COVID-19. The claim was published on Facebook here on July 20, 2020 by Australian professional boxer Anthony Mundine, who has more than 88,000 followers.

One category of evidence comes from laboratory studies of respiratory droplets and the ability of various masks to block them. An experiment using high-speed video found that hundreds of droplets ranging from 20 to 500 micrometers were generated when saying a simple phrase, but that nearly all these droplets were blocked when the mouth was covered by a damp washcloth. Another study of people who had influenza or the common cold found that wearing a surgical mask significantly reduced the amount of these respiratory viruses emitted in droplets and aerosols. But the strongest evidence in favor of masks come from studies of real-world scenarios. “The most important thing are the epidemiologic data,” said Rutherford.

The latter found surgical masks decreased emission of large particles (larger than 5 µm) by 25-fold and small particles by threefold from flu-infected patients.33 Sung37 found a 43% reduction in respiratory viral infections in stem-cell patients when everyone, including patients, visitors, and healthcare workers, wore surgical masks. In sum, wearing surgical masks in households appears to have very little impact on transmission of respiratory disease. One possible reason may be that masks are not likely worn continuously in households. These data suggest that surgical masks worn by the public will have no or very low impact on disease transmission during a pandemic. There is no evidence that surgical masks worn by healthcare workers are effective at limiting the emission of small particles or in preventing contamination of wounds during surgery.

As anticipated, the tested surgical masks showed a much higher particle penetration because they are known to be less efficient than the N95 respirators. The 2 surgical masks, which originated from the same manufacturer, showed tremendously different penetration levels of the MS2 virions: 20.5% and 84.5%, respectively, at an inhalation flow rate of 85 L/min. Conclusion: The N95 filtering face piece respirators may not provide the expected protection level against small virions. Some surgical masks may let a significant fraction of airborne viruses penetrate through their filters, providing very low protection against aerosolized infectious agents in the size range of 10 to 80 nm.

Another factor to remember, noted Rutherford, is that you could still catch the virus through the membranes in your eyes, a risk that masking does not eliminate. How many people need to wear masks to reduce community transmission? “What you want is 100 percent of people to wear masks, but you’ll settle for 80 percent,” said Rutherford. In one simulation, researchers predicted that 80 percent of the population wearing masks would do more to reduce COVID-19 spread than a strict lockdown.

While this is not an exhaustive review of masks and respirators as source control and PPE, we made our best effort to locate and review the most relevant studies of laboratory and real-world performance to inform our recommendations. Results from laboratory studies of filter and fit performance inform and support the findings in real-world settings. Cloth masks are ineffective as source control and PPE, surgical masks have some role to play in preventing emissions from infected patients, and respirators are the best choice for protecting healthcare and other frontline workers, but not recommended for source control.

Too many faith leaders and community members have already become infected by or passed away because of COVID-19. Many of them lost their lives while in service to their communities, some even sacrificing their own lives to save others. Prohibiting houses of worship from gathering in person is a necessary step to protect other faith leaders and community members—and indeed everyone—from falling ill. For many faith communities, it is an incredibly painful experience to close the doors of one’s house of worship.

Many religious organizations have found new and creative ways to gather for worship, pray together, and continue community social service work. Faith community leaders deserve praise for their efforts to combat the coronavirus; they serve as trusted messengers who affect the daily lives of people of faith outside faith-specific spaces. While most faith communities are choosing to follow public health guidance, religious exemptions only encourage some religious entities and leaders to disregard or even openly challenge public health guidance: “We are not stopping anything,” Pastor Rodney Howard-Browne said to his River Tampa Bay Church in Florida. “I’ve got news for you, this church will never close.” In Ohio, Gov.

Fortunately, most faith communities, in the absence of government leadership, have chosen to act responsibly and have ended all in-person gatherings during this crisis. Many faith leaders are connecting online, sharing resources and supporting one another. For example, faith leaders seeking ideas and support for this new way of leading and ministering to their communities may request to join a private Facebook group called “Multifaith Clergy & Spiritual Communal Responses to COVID-19,” which aims to address these issues. During this unprecedented time of crisis, most faith communities are stepping up and doing whatever they can to respond reasonably and responsibly to this pandemic. The very least federal, state, and local governments can do is to include faith communities among those they seek to protect.

However, at a time when it is crucial to respond thoughtfully and prudently to this pandemic, there is an alarming trend of government officials ignoring public health warnings and refusing to call on houses of worship to close. Establishing religious exemptions—in this case, by freeing houses of worship from public health order compliance—will only result in more cases of COVID-19 and greater numbers of death from the disease. Thankfully, many religious communities, which sit at the nexus of caring for people and being a focal point of community gatherings, are leading efforts to flatten the curve. A diverse group of religious organizations, including the National Association of Evangelicals, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and the newly established National Muslim Task Force on COVID-19, have called for suspending in-person services.
		

Have any U.S. mayors officially implemented fines for attending church services during the COVID-19 pandemic?		
GREENVILLE, Miss. — Churchgoers who attended a drive-in service at a church in Greenville, Mississippi, were fined $500 for reportedly violating a curfew order from the mayor. During Thursday night service at King James Bible Baptist Church, while parishoners sat in their vehicles listening to Pastor Charles Hamilton, Greenville Police surrounded the church parking lot. Jeremy Dys, with First Liberty Institute, is representing Pastor Hamilton and says police were violating the church’s constitutional right while enforcing a curfew order from Mayor Errick Simmons. “They park in their parking spaces, they keep their windows up, the doors closed, they never get out of the cars like the CDC recommends they do,” Dys said.

Barr said Tuesday that the department ""will continue to ensure that religious freedom remains protected if any state or local government, in their response to COVID-19, singles out, targets, or discriminates against any house of worship for special restrictions."" The government noted that federal, state and local governments must strike a delicate balance during an emergency like a pandemic, weighing constitutional liberties against drastic safety measures needed to stop the spread of the virus, like business closures and curfews. ""Courts reviewing a challenge to a measure responding to the 'society-threatening epidemic' of COVID-19 should be vigilant to protect against clear invasions of constitutional rights while ensuring they do 'not second-guess the wisdom or efficacy of the measures' enacted by the democratic branches of government, on the advice of public health experts,"" the government attorneys wrote, citing a recent ruling by the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals.

In particular, all services should be provided through remote telework from home unless they are essential services that cannot be provided through remote telework. If religious services cannot be conducted from home or through remote services, they should be conducted consistent with the Guidelines from the President and the CDC by practicing good hygiene, environmental cleanliness, and sanitation, and by implementing social distancing to prevent the spread of COVID-19. In accordance with the Guidelines from the President and the CDC, people shall avoid eating or drinking at bars, restaurants, and food courts, or visiting gyms, massage establishments, tattoo studios, piercing studios, or cosmetology salons; provided, however, that the use of drive-thru, pickup, or delivery options for food and drinks is allowed and highly encouraged throughout the limited duration of this executive order. This executive order does not prohibit people from accessing essential services or engaging in essential daily activities, such as going to the grocery store or gas station, providing or obtaining other essential services, visiting parks, hunting or fishing, or engaging in physical activity like jogging or bicycling, so long as the necessary precautions are maintained to reduce the transmission of COVID-19 and to minimize in-person contact with people who are not in the same household.

Who are essential workers?: A comprehensive look at their wages, demographics, and unionization rates While the coronavirus pandemic has shut down much of the U.S. economy, with over 33 million workers applying for unemployment insurance since March 15, millions of workers are still on the job providing essential services. Nearly every state governor has issued executive orders that outline industries deemed “essential” during the pandemic, which typically include health care, food service, and public transportation, among others. However, despite being categorized as essential, many workers in these industries are not receiving the most basic health and safety measures to combat the spread of the coronavirus.

Under longstanding California law, if an adult has voluntary penile-vaginal intercourse with a minor aged 14, 15, 16, or 17 and is up to 10 years older than the minor, the offense is not automatically registerable. A judge has discretion whether or not to place the defendant on the sex offender registry. By contrast, if the sexual act is oral sex, anal sex or digital penetration, the court must place the defendant on the sex offender registry regardless of the facts of the crime and even in cases where the prosecutor does not want to place the defendant on the registry.

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump announced Friday he would withdraw funding from the World Health Organization, end Hong Kong’s special trade status and suspend visas of Chinese graduate students suspected of conducting research on behalf of their government — escalating tensions with China that have surged during the coronavirus pandemic. Trump has been expressing anger at the World Health Organization for weeks over what he has portrayed as an inadequate response to the initial outbreak of the coronavirus in China’s Wuhan province late last year. The president said in a brief White House announcement that Chinese officials “ignored” their reporting obligations to the WHO and pressured the organization to mislead the public about an outbreak that has now killed more than 100,000 people in the United States. “We have detailed the reforms that it must make and engaged with them directly, but they have refused to act,” the president said.

A decision on whether the US resumes funding will be made after the review, which Mr Trump said would last 60 to 90 days. The WHO is yet to directly respond but UN Secretary General António Guterres said the international community should be uniting ""in solidarity to stop this virus"". ""It is my belief that the World Health Organization must be supported, as it is absolutely critical to the world's efforts to win the war against Covid-19,"" he said.

President Donald Trump announced on Friday that the United States will terminate its relationship with the World Health Organization, a move he has threatened throughout the coronavirus pandemic and one that earned quick criticism from both sides of the aisle. “Because they have failed to make the requested and greatly needed reforms, we will be today terminating our relationship with the World Health Organization and redirecting those funds to other worldwide and deserving, urgent global public health needs,” Trump said. The President said that the “world needs answers from China on the virus. We must have transparency.” At the same event on Friday, Trump launched a blistering attack on China, including a slew of retaliatory measures that will plunge US-China relations deeper into crisis.

Donald Trump was condemned for putting countless lives at risk on Tuesday when he announced the US is freezing payments to the World Health Organization (WHO) over its handling of the coronavirus pandemic. The US president said funding would be on hold for 60 to 90 days pending a review of the WHO’s warnings about the coronavirus and China. He accused the global body of “severely mismanaging and covering up” the threat, even though it declared a public health emergency on 30 January – after which he continued to hold rallies, play golf and compare the coronavirus to the common flu. Critics were stunned at the move to cut money from a critical UN agency during a global pandemic. António Guterres, the UN secretary general, declared now was “not the time to reduce the resources for the operations of the World Health Organization or any other humanitarian organization in the fight against the virus.

Trump’s decision to permanently terminate the US relationship with the WHO follows a years-long pattern of skepticism of world organizations, with the President claiming in nearly every circumstance that the US was being taken advantage of. The President has questioned US funding to the United Nations and the Northern Atlantic Treaty Organization, withdrawn from the Paris climate accords and repeatedly criticized the World Trade Organization.

- The Trump administration has blamed China for misleading the world about the extent of the crisis, and some officials have suggested that the virus originated in a Chinese laboratory. In April 2020, Trump announced that he would freeze funding to the World Health Organization over his concerns that it is beholden to China’s interests, and in July, he said he would withdraw the United States from the body completely. It is unclear whether the president can do so without congressional approval. Trump has called for an approach that combines increased domestic surveillance, expanded use of drone strikes in Africa and the Middle East, and tighter limits on immigration and refugee admissions.
		

Did President Trump issue an executive order or directive to suspend U.S. funding to the World Health Organization in response to concerns about its handling of the COVID-19 pandemic?		
Mr Trump has been under fire for his own handling of the pandemic. He has sought to deflect persistent criticism that he acted too slowly to stop the virus's spread by pointing to his decision in late January to place restrictions on travel from China. He has accused the WHO of having ""criticised"" that decision and of being biased towards China more generally. ""I am directing my administration to halt funding while a review is conducted to assess the World Health Organization's role in severely mismanaging and covering up the spread of the coronavirus,"" Mr Trump told a news conference at the White House on Tuesday.

He told NPR: ""What will happen instead is that the U.S. role will be diminished and that we won't be able to bring our best experts into the room when discussions are taking place."" In a statement, the American Medical Association said, ""The Trump administration's official withdrawal from the World Health Organization (WHO) puts the health of our country at grave risk. ""...

454,Face masks cause hypoxia.,"Do studies or credible scientific research support the claim that face masks cause hypoxia in healthy individuals during normal use?		
Fact check: Wearing a face mask will not cause hypoxia, hypoxemia or hypercapnia The claim: Face masks drastically reduce oxygen intake, cause carbon dioxide toxicity As states are reopening, health guidelines recommend that people maintain social distancing, practice hand-washing and wear face masks. The use of face masks is encouraged by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and members of the White House's coronavirus task force to prevent further spread of the coronavirus, especially in places where it is hard to social distance.
		

Do studies or credible scientific research support the claim that face masks cause hypoxia in healthy individuals during normal use?		
But the same effects are not likely in people wearing cloth face masks, especially for the brief amount of time they are in public. The claims in the post have been rated PARTLY FALSE, based on our research. There is no evidence to support that the general public — which doesn't typically wear masks for prolonged periods of time — will experience significant reductions in oxygen intake level, resulting in hypoxemia. While CO2 can build up in face masks, it is unlikely that wearing a mask will cause hypercapnia, according to the CDC
		

Do studies or credible scientific research support the claim that face masks cause hypoxia in healthy individuals during normal use?		
There is no proof that wearing a mask can reduce oxygen levels, also known as hypoxia. The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S. CDC) recommend wearing cloth masks over a surgical mask in public, which are not too tight on our faces and allow for easy breathing. Even doctors and healthcare professionals wearing N95 masks (which fit very tightly around the face and are made to create a seal around the edge of the mask) are not at risk of hypoxia. However, for any person with preexisting lung or breathing problems in general, they should speak with their doctors about their concerns regarding masks. Since the World Health Organization and U.S. CDC have recommended wearing masks to prevent the spread of COVID-19, face masks have become a target of political discussions.
		

Do studies or credible scientific research support the claim that face masks cause hypoxia in healthy individuals during normal use?		
People have shared a graphic titled ""danger of a face mask"" and say this ""may lead to death"". But the breathable materials recommended for face masks worn properly won't inhibit your breathing. Breathlessness is a sign that your body is deprived of oxygen - known as hypoxia. ""Thin paper or cloth masks will not lead to hypoxia. Surgeons operate for hours wearing them. They don't get these problems,"" says Prof Keith Neal, an infectious disease expert.

Additionally, the CDC told Reuters, ""The CO2 will slowly build up in the mask over time. However, the level of CO2 likely to build up in the mask is mostly tolerable to people exposed to it ... It is unlikely that wearing a mask will cause hypercapnia."" Poynter notes that the rumor of mask wearing causing hypoxia has circulated the globe for a month or more, and has been fact-checked by several organizations. The CDC told Snopes that N95 respirators could cause the buildup of carbon dioxide over time, which can also be mitigated by feeding in oxygen or simply taking a break and removing the mask.

Generally at sea level, any fall in the inspired O2 fraction and the corresponding decrease in PaO2 does not stimulate increased ventilation via peripheral chemoreceptors until PaO2 is <60 mm Hg (25); this extent of hypoxemia is not expected with face masks (see below). With some degree of hypercapnia, the threshold for hypoxic stimulation moves to a higher PaO2. Nevertheless, it is the reinspiration of CO2 that would be the driving force for any increases in ventilation when breathing through a face mask. In normoxia, even a 1–mm Hg rise in PaCO2 will stimulate ventilation (26). Importantly, any changes in ventilation will be greater with exertion because the higher metabolic rate with exercise itself increases the ventilatory responsiveness to CO2 and O2 (27, 28). There are limited data reporting arterial blood gases during exercise while wearing a face mask. Arterial saturation remains above 97% while wearing a surgical mask or N95 respirator while exercising at moderate intensity for 60 minutes (29, 30), indicating that changes in PaO2 sufficient to affect ventilation are unlikely.

But the channel never got off the ground. According to a commission report, Fox News told the Canadian network Global News Network that it ""did not wish to have its signal interrupted by the insertion of Canadian programming as would be required under the licence for Fox News Canada."" Fox News executive Janet Alshouse said there were no serious discussions with Global nor was there ever a partnership. After the project fizzled out in 2004, the regulators approved Fox for broadcast on Canadian airwaves via satellite in the same year.

Facebook posts on Monday, July 14th, 2014 in posts on Facebook Red foxes may roam all over Canada but you won't catch the conservative news network there, according to an Internet meme circulating since 2011.

Is Fox News currently accessible to Canadian viewers through any legal means, such as satellite, cable, or online streaming services, despite any existing media legislation?		
Since at least 2011, rumors have circulated claiming the Fox News television channel has been banned in Canada due to their running afoul of Canadian Radio-Television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) prohibitions that make it ""illegal to broadcast lies and label it news"": One prominent example of this rumor stated, for example, that: America's middle class battles for its survival on the Wisconsin barricades — against various Koch Oil surrogates and the corporate toadies at Fox News — fans of enlightenment, democracy and justice can take comfort from a significant victory north of the Wisconsin border. Fox News will not be moving into Canada after all! The reason: Canadian regulators announced last week they would reject efforts by Canada's right-wing Prime Minister, Stephen Harper, to repeal a law that forbids lying on broadcast news.
		

Is Fox News currently accessible to Canadian viewers through any legal means, such as satellite, cable, or online streaming services, despite any existing media legislation?		
The CRTC regulations apply only to Canadian broadcasters using Canadian airwaves; they do not apply to the Fox News Channel, which is a non-Canadian entity transmitted via satellite and cable, not broadcast over public airwaves. Fox Chairman and CEO Rupert Murdoch was rebuffed in his efforts to establish Fox News Canada in 2003 due to Canadian laws regarding foreign ownership of print and broadcast media, but the CRTC approved an application to bring the Fox News Channel to Canadian digital television line-ups back in November 2004, and that channel is now carried by dozens of different digital providers throughout Canada. (The claimed distinction that Fox News Channel is only allowed in Canada due to its being classified as an ""entertainment"" channel rather than as a ""news"" channel is a meaningless one, as those classifications only apply to Canadian media outlets, and Fox is an American company.) The Fox television network (known as the Fox Broadcasting Company), which is a broadcast entity distinctly different from the Fox News Channel, does not have any affiliates or owned-and-operated stations in Canada, but Fox network programming is carried on cable and satellite providers in Canada and is available over the airwaves through several U.S. stations located near the U.S.-Canada border.

Its powers have allowed it to act in an effective, efficient, and proportionate manner to authorize market entry and oversee the state of competition in certain markets, targeting intervention as necessary and appropriate. However, the CRTC does not have the explicit authority to collect information from all service providers that operate in Canada's broadcasting environment as it does under the Telecommunications Act where it has broad powers to obtain and, where necessary, investigate any information reasonably necessary to administer its legislation.

The specific reasons for the abnormally high number of police shootings in the U.S., as well as their racial disparity, are matters of considerable debate. Also, while the number of police shootings in the U.S. is still abnormally high, it is noteworthy that once that number is evaluated in relation to the total population, the U.S. drops out of the top ten. When compared by the number of police killings per 10 million residents, the U.S. ranks 33rd. While this is an improvement, its number of 28.54 per 10 million residents is nearly double that of the next-highest developed country (Luxembourg, whose population is so small that a single killing gave in a 16.9 score) and nearly three times that of Canada (9.7).

The annual per capita number of officers killed has dropped from 24 per 100,000 in the 10 years to 1980 to 7.3 per 100,000 in the 10 years to 2013 (the last year for which there is good data). This chimes with a bigger trend, which is a steady reduction in crime, including homicides.
		

What are the most recent statistics on the number of people killed by police per capita in South Africa and the United States?		
Each nation listed below either accompanies the US in the G7 group of the world’s most advanced economies, or is ranked similarly on global wealth, freedom and democracy indexes. But when it comes to policing and criminal justice, the US is a noticeable outlier, and black Americans are disproportionately affected. Data on arrests, deaths and prison populations do not exist uniformly across developed countries, so it can be difficult to pinpoint exactly how the US fares in comparison to every nation. For instance, it is impossible to know exactly how many people die at the hands of police officers in the US each year: no single, nationwide database that contains such information exists.
		

What are the most recent statistics on the number of people killed by police per capita in South Africa and the United States?		
Police officers are more likely to use force on black Americans – and, according to a 2016 study published in the American Journal of Health, black men are nearly three times more likely than white men to be killed by police intervention. Comparable figures for other countries are not readily available. In general, more Americans are subjected to the cogs of the criminal justice system than in many other countries; and more end up in prison, too. The US has the largest prison population in the world, as well as the largest incarceration rate per capita, according to World Prison Brief – a London-based initiative that counts inmate populations around the world annually.

These deponents stated that they were subjected to severe pain and suffering, as a result of beatings with iron bars and baseball bats, waterboarding, forced removal of their clothing, and electric shocks applied to their genitals and thighs. They were also subjected to mock executions during which they were hooded and a gun was pressed against their heads. The deponents further stated that they were tortured in order to obtain confessions regarding their purported involvement with the MDC.

An investigation within the South African territory does not offend against the principle of non-intervention and there is no evidence that Zimbabwe has launched any investigation or has indicated that it is willing to do so, given the period of time since the alleged commission of the crimes. Furthermore, the threshold for the SAPS to decline to investigate, bearing in mind the particular facts and circumstances, has not been met in this case. There is a reasonable possibility that the SAPS will gather evidence that may satisfy the elements of the crime of torture allegedly committed in Zimbabwe.

[45] On a regional level, both South Africa and Zimbabwe have signed and ratified the African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights, 27 June 1981 (African Charter) and are therefore bound by it. The African Charter, in article 5, protects the rights to dignity and to be free from all forms of exploitation and degradation, including torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading punishment and treatment. The African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights (African Commission), the institution charged with ensuring compliance with the African Charter, has declared that the prohibition in article 5, which includes torture, must be interpreted to include the widest possible array of physical and mental abuse. See Huri-Laws v Nigeria (2000) AHRLR 273 (ACHPR 2000). This suggests that there is an obligation under article 5 for South Africa to investigate torture allegations.

But the regulators were concerned with the effect of foreign competition on Canadian networks, not with Fox News’ truthfulness. Years earlier in 2000, regulators approved a proposal for Fox News Canada, which was to include content from both countries under media content law. But the channel never got off the ground. According to a commission report, Fox News told the Canadian network Global News Network that it ""did not wish to have its signal interrupted by the insertion of Canadian programming as would be required under the licence for Fox News Canada.""

They are an essential part of American history and embody the strong and resilient characteristics of the American people - so much so that they were designated as our National Mammal in 2016. Once numbering ~30 million and ranging across the United States and in Canada and Mexico, bison were hunted to near extinction, with only several hundred remaining by the 1870’s. Through ongoing conservation work, bison are recovering from a low of fewer than 1,000 individuals. Today, 19 herds in 12 states roam the American Plains. Explore this website to learn more about bison, where you can see these majestic animals, and what the National Park Service is doing to protect them.
		

What is the current estimated population of North American bison?		
During the 19th century, settlers killed some 50 million bison for food, sport, and to deprive Native Americans of their most important natural asset. The once enormous herds were reduced to only a few hundred animals. Today, bison numbers have rebounded somewhat, and about 500,000 bison live on preserves and ranches where they are raised for their meat.

What is the current estimated population of North American bison?		
Today their numbers have rebounded to around 350,000—about 1% of their original herd size—but enough to keep them out of the dangers of extinction. Approximately 15,000 animals can be found across the public lands of the United States. Remaining bison populations are in private herds such as those maintained by The Nature Conservancy. The Nature Conservancy has plains bison (Bison bison bison) on twelve native grassland preserves in North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, Colorado, Kansas, Missouri and Oklahoma. Eleven of these herds are owned and managed by the Conservancy and one herd is owned by a university that manages the TNC-university owned preserve.

What is the current estimated population of North American bison?		
Fortunately, during the time wild bison herds were being destroyed, a number of people were developing small captive herds. Bison now seen in national wildlife refuges and in parks came largely from three of these captive herds. Today, the success of that effort is reflected in over 75,000 bison now roaming both public and private lands in the United States. The bison is the largest land animal in North America. It normally lives 15 to 20 years but can live up to 40 years.
		

What is the current estimated population of North American bison?		
Hi Rex, Could you provide a reference for the statement “Hunting by white folk is not an adequate explanation for their near extinction?” I have been taught the near extinction of the bison was due to slaughter for market or sport and to starve the Native Americans into submission. No reference, but some context. Estimates used by Penn State and Mari Sandoz and others are that there were about 100 million bison. That is about the same as the total American cattle population. Weekly cattle slaughter last week was 571,000 head per the most recent USDA report or 28 million annually.
		

What is the current estimated population of North American bison?		
Had it not been for a few private individuals working with tribes, states and the Interior Department, the bison would be extinct today. 1. Bison are the largest mammal in North America. Male bison (called bulls) weigh up to 2,000 pounds and stand 6 feet tall, while females (called cows) weigh up to 1,000 pounds and reach a height of 4-5 feet. 2. Since the late 19th century, [the Department of the] Interior has been the primary national conservation steward of the bison. Public lands managed by Interior support 17 bison herds—or approximately 10,000 bison—in 12 states, including Alaska.
		

What is the current estimated population of North American bison?		
Thanks Steve, that’s helpful insight and I’ll check out those accounts. Steve Nelle makes some excellent points. I’d like to mention a couple of other things. In the article, Hart correctly points out that Native American communities put some limit on bison populations. However, from 1500-1700 the Native American population was reduced by 90% from exposure to European disease. My own Tribe was originally located in Mississippi. At the time of European contact, there were no bison in our country and hadn’t been since just after the Pleistocene.
		

What is the current estimated population of North American bison?		
On May 9, 2016, President Obama signed the National Bison Legacy Act into law, officially making the American bison the national mammal of the United States. This majestic animal joins the ranks of the bald eagle as the official symbol of our country—and much like the eagle, it's one of the greatest conservation success stories of all time. In prehistoric times, millions of bison roamed North America—from the forests of Alaska and the grasslands of Mexico to Nevada’s Great Basin and the eastern Appalachian Mountains. But by the late 1800s, there were only a few hundred bison left in the United States after European settlers pushed west, reducing the animal’s habitat and hunting the bison to near extinction.

465,Jacob Blake raped a 14 year old teenage girl.,"What are the verified facts or legal findings regarding the allegations against Jacob Blake?		
As part of that effort, a rumor emerged in the days after the shooting that claimed Blake had been charged with a sexual assault offense that involved sexual penetration of a minor between 14 and 16 years old, and that he was therefore a ""child rapist"" and ""pedophile."" Others alleged specifically that Blake had ""raped a 14 year old girl"" and ""raped a child."" Many of those social media posts featured a graphic that comprised what appeared to be a list of charges against a defendant named Jacob S. Blake, including ""third degree sexual assault,"" juxtaposed with what appeared to be a definition of ""third degree sexual assault"" taken from a statute. ""A person is guilty of third degree sexual assault if he or she is over the age of eighteen (18) years and engaged in sexual penetration with another person over the age of fourteen (14) years and under the age of consent, sixteen (16) years of age.""
		

What are the verified facts or legal findings regarding the allegations against Jacob Blake?		
Specifically, the claim falsely suggests that he served time in prison for “raping the 14 year old.” “Jacob Blake is shot by police while resisting arrest,” a meme repeatedly shared on Facebook — in one example by 11,000 users — claims. “He wouldn’t have been shot if he was still in prison for raping the 14 year old.” The posts offer no evidence for the claim, and the allegation doesn’t comport with publicly available records.
		

What are the verified facts or legal findings regarding the allegations against Jacob Blake?		
Thus, the claim was that Blake had been charged with an offense that involved the sexual penetration of a minor, and he therefore raped a child. In reality, Blake was not accused of having raped a child, and that claim was false. Rather, Blake faced charges of having sexually assaulted his ex-girlfriend, with whom he has three children in common. In July 2020, prosecutors in Kenosha County successfully applied for an arrest warrant for Blake on charges of third-degree sexual assault, criminal trespass, and disorderly conduct, all of which were additionally designated as acts of domestic abuse. That warrant was issued on July 7. (Through a variety of methods, Snopes was able to independently verify that the Jacob Blake who was shot by police in August 2020 is indeed the same person for whom an arrest warrant was issued in July 2020.)
		

What are the verified facts or legal findings regarding the allegations against Jacob Blake?		
Posts on social media falsely claim that the man shot by police in Kenosha, Wisconsin, “wouldn’t have been shot if he was still in prison for raping the 14 year old.” There’s no evidence he was ever charged with such a crime — let alone convicted and imprisoned. Jacob Blake was charged in July with sexually assaulting an adult woman, but has not been convicted. The Aug. 23 shooting of Jacob Blake by police in Kenosha, Wisconsin, set off protests against police brutality in the city — as well as distorted and unfounded claims on social media. One viral claim on Facebook targets Blake, who his family’s attorney says was paralyzed by the shooting, by altering the known facts about criminal charges against him.
		

What are the verified facts or legal findings regarding the allegations against Jacob Blake?		
Whoever created the widely shared graphic therefore took a screenshot of an authentic list of charges against Blake, including third-degree sexual assault, but juxtaposed it with an excerpt from the laws of a different state, in order to give readers the entirely false impression that Blake had been accused of committing an act of sexual penetration against a child. He had not. Claims that Blake was a ""child rapist"" and had ""raped a child"" were therefore baseless. A search of Blake's name in Wisconsin Circuit Court records revealed only child support disputes and a June 2018 conviction in Racine County on a charge of operating a vehicle without being in possession of a driver's license, which is not a criminal offense and was resolved with a fine. Blake is not listed on the Wisconsin Department of Corrections Sex Offender Registry.
		

What are the verified facts or legal findings regarding the allegations against Jacob Blake?		
Blake, 29, was in fact charged in a domestic abuse case in July with third-degree sexual assault, Wisconsin court records show. The state statute cited does not specify that the charge relates to sexually assaulting a minor. He was also charged with trespassing and disorderly conduct; he has not been convicted, let alone imprisoned. There was an active arrest warrant for Blake on those charges, which police officers were reportedly alerted to prior to the shooting. A criminal complaint shows that the charges relate to an incident with an adult woman; FactCheck.org is not providing other details about the victim because of the nature of the alleged crime.
		

What are the verified facts or legal findings regarding the allegations against Jacob Blake?		
Thus, social media posts that described Blake as a ""convicted sex offender"" and ""convicted rapist"" were inaccurate at the time they were posted. On Aug. 24, 2020, retired police officer and right-wing commentator Brandon Tatum published a widely shared tweet in which he labeled Blake a ""domestic abuser and sex offender"" and included a screenshot of the 2015 Racine County Eye article, adding the claim that Blake was ""known for pulling guns on people."" As of Aug. 26, 2020, Blake had not yet even entered a plea in relation to the domestic abuse and sexual assault charges against him, not to mention being tried or convicted on them, and the latter accusation had to do with charges that were dropped by the prosecutor in the case.
		

What are the verified facts or legal findings regarding the allegations against Jacob Blake?		
According to a criminal complaint filed by the Kenosha County District Attorney's office in July 2020, Blake is accused of having entered his ex-girlfriend's home in Kenosha, without her permission, on May 3, 2020, before sexually assaulting her, taking her car and debit card, and making two ATM withdrawals of $500 each. Blake and his ex-girlfriend have three children in common. The complaint can be read in full here. Some readers might find it disturbing because it contains descriptions of alleged sexual assault and domestic abuse. The allegations against Blake in July 2020 were unquestionably serious and included a charge of third-degree sexual assault against his ex-girlfriend, which was aggravated by the alleged involvement of domestic abuse. However, no allegation of harming a child was made against Blake.

What are the verified facts or legal findings regarding the allegations against Jacob Blake?		
The actual charges, while no doubt serious, are therefore not proof that Blake “wouldn’t have been shot if he was still in prison for raping the 14 year old.” We could find no other evidence to support that claim. Wisconsin’s Sex Offender Registry offers no matches for his name. Other cases in Wisconsin’s court records include a traffic violation and the custody disputes. Ironically, the meme spreading the claim uses an image of John Krasinski, an actor from the TV show “The Office” who has expressed support for the Black Lives Matter movement.

The decision to declare an AMBER Alert is made by each police organization (in many cases, the state police or highway patrol) investigating the abduction. Public information in an AMBER Alert usually includes the name and description of the abductee, a description of the suspected abductor, and a description and license plate number of the abductor's vehicle. The AMBER Alert system issues media alerts when a law enforcement agency determines that a child was abducted and is in imminent danger. The Alabama Law Enforcement Agency (ALEA) was created by Act 2013-67 and represents the consolidation and realignment of 12 state law enforcement agencies/functions into one entity.

468,"Even with a voter ID card, you won’t be allowed to vote in Ghana on December 7 if your name is not found in the Register. So, people should take advantage of the exhibition exercise to verify their names.","Is it true that, in Ghana, having a voter ID card is not sufficient to vote on December 7 if your name does not appear on the voter register, and why is it important for individuals to verify their names during the exhibition exercise?		
Claim: Even with a voter ID card, you won’t be allowed to vote on December 7 if your name is not found in the Register. So, people should take advantage of the exhibition exercise to verify their names. Campaigning to win the December elections, the leader of the opposition National Democratic Congress (NDC) John Mahama is touring the Oti region, one of Ghana’s 16 regions. The former President as part of the tour made a stop at Ahamansu, a farming community in the Kadjebi District and addressed locals, making a number of claims about the performance of the current government while pitching his plans for the country and why people should give his party the mandate in the upcoming elections.
		

Is it true that, in Ghana, having a voter ID card is not sufficient to vote on December 7 if your name does not appear on the voter register, and why is it important for individuals to verify their names during the exhibition exercise?		
So, I will plead with you all, to show the same enthusiasm during the registration period and check if our names have been correctly captured during the exhibition of the Register.” “There will be no opportunity to remedy the situation on voting day if you fail to verify your details when we exhibit the register.” A Deputy Chairman of the Electoral Commission Dr Bossman Asare confirmed in an interview with GhanaFact. The conduct of Ghana’s 2020 elections will be guided by Constitutional Instrument(C.I.) 91 and according to the Electoral Commission, the process demands the exhibition of the register for voters to verify their details.
		

Is it true that, in Ghana, having a voter ID card is not sufficient to vote on December 7 if your name does not appear on the voter register, and why is it important for individuals to verify their names during the exhibition exercise?		
It is easy for anyone without ID documents to have their name entered on the voter’s roll even if the registration is biometric. The Electoral Commission’s panel’s inquiry into the matter came to the same conclusion: ‘there is … currently, no reliable objective way of confirming the citizenship of an individual’. Political parties in Ghana exploit the difficulties of establishing with certainty the citizenship of an individual. Since the law does not satisfactorily determine who the electorate is, political parties raise questions that cast doubt on the legality of the vote of those whose citizenship is difficult to establish, when it is deemed strategically useful.

Speaking in an indigenous Ghanaian language-Twi, the NDC Presidential candidate said between minutes 5:04 and 5:35 that: “If the day comes and you come with your voter ID claiming you’ve registered, but your name is not found in the (Voters) Register, you won’t be allowed to vote.
		

Is it true that, in Ghana, having a voter ID card is not sufficient to vote on December 7 if your name does not appear on the voter register, and why is it important for individuals to verify their names during the exhibition exercise?		
Strangely, the issue bears similarities with an older debate in Ghana: the vote of the diaspora. The Representation of the People’s Amendment Act (ROPAA 2006) made it legal for Ghanaians abroad to vote. The NDC claimed that this law was a means to rig elections since it enabled the enrolling of potential unqualified voters abroad. The Constitutional Instrument to apply the law was not introduced, so the law was never applied. The debate is coming back to the fore with the upcoming 2020 elections. The similarities on the terms of the debate are striking. In both, a party accuses the other of electoral malpractice by enrolling potential foreigners on the voters’ register.

Many people, theoretically, are dual citizens and should not be excluded from the vote in Ghana. In practice, however, how can one identify a Ghanaian citizen? Many individuals do not have identity documents. In Ghana, when an individual cannot prove their citizenship with documents but wishes to register on the voters’ roll, the law specifies that two persons vouch for the individual.

471,The Trump RNC Acceptance Speech Was The First Time The White House Was Used For 'Purely Political Campaign Event',"Has the White House been used for any other political campaign events prior to the Trump RNC acceptance speech?		
WASHINGTON — Several rows of stage lights could be seen peeking above the colonial style windows of the West Wing when the sun rose Friday as the atmosphere of the White House began to transition, for the first time, into a purely political venue. Behind the scenes this past week, campaign and convention staffers began work on the White House South Lawn setting up lights, speakers and a stage that would be used for President Donald Trump to deliver his acceptance speech as the Republican Party’s presidential nominee. Trucks brought in long metal poles and beams, and construction equipment was set up adjacent to the Rose Garden. It is unprecedented in modern politics for the White House to be used as the site of an explicitly political event, with past presidents maintaining some boundaries between the office of the presidency and their re-election bids.
		

Has the White House been used for any other political campaign events prior to the Trump RNC acceptance speech?		
Trump had pushed to hold an in-person convention, first in North Carolina then in Florida, but abruptly canceled those plans just over 30 days before it was set to begin, sending staffers scrambling to come up with an alternative plan. It was only on Monday that Trump announced he had settled on the White House for his speech. The Trump campaign and Republican National Committee have said they will reimburse the federal government for any taxpayer resources used. White House lawyers have briefed staffers on what they can and cannot do as part of the convention planning and participation, and White House press staffers last week were quick to say they had no involvement in the convention planning outside their office doors, telling reporters to direct any questions to the Trump campaign.
		

Has the White House been used for any other political campaign events prior to the Trump RNC acceptance speech?		
But she did have a warning for other staffers involved in the event. ""The President and Vice President are not covered by any of the provisions of the Hatch Act. Accordingly, the Hatch Act does not prohibit President Trump from delivering his RNC acceptance speech on White House grounds,"" Hamrick wrote. ""However, White House employees are covered by the Hatch Act, so there may be Hatch Act implications for those employees, depending on their level of involvement with the event and their position in the White House."" She said employees would not be able to assist with the proceedings or attend while they are on duty or if it were to occur in a federal room or building.

And he went on to win that record-shattering third term in an electoral landslide. So what about Trump’s convention videos shot in the White House premises make Democrats huff? Surely that’s a first, right? Consider a campaign video from the 1984 election. In it, President Ronald Reagan is standing on the South Lawn. He turns, gestures to the White House seen over his shoulder, and begins with these words: “This place has a way of making us think about the kind of future our young people will have.
		

Has the White House been used for any other political campaign events prior to the Trump RNC acceptance speech?		
THE WAY Democrats tell it, Donald Trump has desecrated the White House with cheap campaign politics by using its hallowed halls for his Republican presidential nomination acceptance speech and videos. In fact, the Democrat-controlled House Oversight Committee launched an investigation into whether Trump’s decision to speak from the White House lawn Thursday night is a crime—a potential violation of the Hatch Act, according to House Oversight chair Carolyn Maloney of New York. Democrats claim that Trump’s behavior is unprecedented. In fact, the very Democrat who lived in the President’s House the longest established the precedent. Franklin D. Roosevelt’s wheelchair was pushed into the Diplomatic Reception Room just after midnight on July 19, 1940.

The 43 men (sorry, Mrs. Clinton) who have occupied the White House were keenly interested in, and deeply involved in, party politics. It should come as no surprise then that many of its residents had no qualms about being political as well as presidential while living there as well.
		

Has the White House been used for any other political campaign events prior to the Trump RNC acceptance speech?		
Trump has been smashing those norms for months — attacking Democratic rival Joe Biden from the Rose Garden and playing campaign-style videos in the White House briefing room — but his prime-time convention address will represent the most blatant blurring of the lines yet. In suggesting the White House for his acceptance speech after surging coronavirus cases forced him to cancel plans for a large in-person convention, Trump said earlier this month it would be “a very convenient location that would be by far the least expensive location. There would be very little in terms of that tremendous traveling, security with airplanes and everybody flying all over the place. But since the convention speech is a political activity, the expense of traveling to deliver it would have been borne by Trump's campaign, not taxpayers.
		

Has the White House been used for any other political campaign events prior to the Trump RNC acceptance speech?		
When cued to begin talking, the president started with these words: “Members of the Convention—My friends …” From there he went on to accept the Democratic nomination for the third consecutive time, a first in presidential history. Some 700 miles away, delegates were listening via a special radio hookup, which was considered high-tech for its time. After formally accepting the nomination and thanking the delegates for the opportunity to be their standard bearer yet again, Roosevelt went on to lay out the foundation for his campaign against Republican Wendell Wilkie that fall.
		

Has the White House been used for any other political campaign events prior to the Trump RNC acceptance speech?		
The stage setup with overhead lights appeared to be half the height of the White House and resembled that of an outdoor music festival, with large speakers off to the side. Unlike Biden, Trump is expected to have a visible live audience for his remarks that will include members of Congress. At least one other convention speech will be made from the White House grounds with first lady Melania Trump expected to make her speech from the recently renovated Rose Garden. The nearby Trump hotel will serve as a workspace for convention staffers.

Trump’s statements about the wall have changed over time. In his presidential campaign, Trump called for about 1,000 miles (1,609 kilometers) of a “great wall on our southern border” of hardened concrete, acknowledging that natural barriers covered much of the rest of the approximately 2,000-mile-long border. At the Republican Party’s 2016 national convention, at which he became its presidential nominee, the party adopted a platform stating “the border wall must cover the entirety of the southern border.” In June of 2017, Trump also told reporters he was seriously considering covering the wall with solar technology.

Has Donald Trump publicly stated or tweeted that Joe Biden is considering dismantling the border wall during his presidency?		
In America, we do not turn to government to restore ourselves. We put our faith in almighty God. Joe Biden is not a savior of America’s soul. He is the destroyer of America’s jobs, and if given the chance, he will be the destroyer of America’s greatness. For 47 years, Joe Biden took the donations of blue-collar workers, gave them hugs, and even kisses, and told them he felt their pain, and then he flew back to Washington, and voted to ship our jobs to China and many other distant lands. Joe Biden spent his entire career outsourcing their dreams and the dreams of American workers, offshoring their jobs, opening their borders and sending their sons and daughters to fight in endless foreign wars, wars that never ended.
		

Has Donald Trump publicly stated or tweeted that Joe Biden is considering dismantling the border wall during his presidency?		
ACTING SECRETARY WOLF: Absolutely. Let me again thank you for your leadership, Mr. President, on providing the resources to build over 450 miles of the new border wall system by the end of this calendar year. Never did we ever dream of that at the beginning of this administration. So thank you for that. Let me also say: A lot of the procedures that we are putting in place today are having a real impact on applying a consequence to those that are entering the country illegally — those that are coming into the country without any legal right to be here. We put enough procedures in place that we are returning 90 percent of those individuals within 120 minutes, to date.
		

Has Donald Trump publicly stated or tweeted that Joe Biden is considering dismantling the border wall during his presidency?

You can’t get away from this, co-authored with far-left senator, crazy Bernie Sanders. The Biden-Bernie manifesto[ calls for suspending all removals of illegal aliens, implementing nationwide catch-and-release, and providing illegal aliens with free taxpayer-funded lawyers. Everybody gets a lawyer. Come over to our country, everybody has a lawyer. We have a lawyer for you. That’s all we need, is more lawyers.

474,"George Floyd died of drug overdose, not US police brutality","What does the official autopsy report say about the cause of George Floyd's death?		
The Hennepin County Medical Examiner's Office has released its final autopsy report for George Floyd, the 46-year-old black man who died in police custody after a Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes. The report lists his cause of death as ""Cardiopulmonary arrest complicating law enforcement subdual, restraint, and neck compression."" In layman's terms, the medical examiner said Floyd died from a sudden failure in his heart's ability to pump blood to his brain due to the stress put on his body by the arresting officer pressing upon his neck. The autopsy report mentions that Floyd also had traces of fentanyl, THC (a chemical compound found in cannabis), morphine and methamphetamine in his system.
		

What does the official autopsy report say about the cause of George Floyd's death?		
Two days later, the county released a statement that attributed Floyd's cause of death to ""cardiopulmonary arrest complicating law enforcement subdual, restraint, and neck compression"" — which essentially means he died because his heart and lungs stopped while he was being restrained by police. That announcement came just hours after Floyd's family released findings of a separate, private autopsy that determined Floyd had indeed died from a combination of Chauvin's knee on his neck and pressure on his back from the other officers. (A copy of that autopsy with all of its details has not been made public.) According to the county's postmortem toxicology screening, which is summarized below and was performed one day after Floyd's death, he was intoxicated with fentanyl and had recently used methamphetamines (as well as other substances) before Chauvin choked him.
		

What does the official autopsy report say about the cause of George Floyd's death?		
The official autopsy by the county medical examiner concluded that Floyd's death was caused by cardiac arrest as police restrained him and compressed his neck. The medical examiner also listed fentanyl intoxication and recent methamphetamine use, but not as causes of death. The autopsy report was released Wednesday. It also showed Floyd tested positive for 2019-nCoV, the coronavirus which causes COVID-19. Crump and the Floyd family commissioned a separate autopsy that concluded he died of asphyxiation due to neck and back compression caused by Chauvin's knee on his neck and other responding officers' knees in his back, which made it impossible for him to breathe.
		

What does the official autopsy report say about the cause of George Floyd's death?		
Independent Autopsy Finds George Floyd Was Asphyxiated UPDATE: The Hennepin County Medical Examiner ruled the death of George Floyd a homicide. It lists his cause of death as “cardiopulmonary arrest complicating law enforcement subdual, restraint, and neck compression,” while adding Floyd “experienced a cardiopulmonary arrest while being restrained by law enforcement officer(s).” It also states “other significant conditions” that could have contributed to Floyd’s death as heart disease, fentanyl intoxication and recent methamphetamine use. An independent autopsy requested by the family of George Floyd found that Floyd died from asphyxiation while former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin knelt on his neck, the New York Times reports.

Independent autopsy finds George Floyd died of homicide by asphyxia The examination was led by a former New York City medical examiner. An independent autopsy ordered by George Floyd's family found his death was a ""homicide caused by asphyxia due to neck and back compression that led to a lack of blood flow to the brain,"" according to early findings from the examination released Monday. Floyd was apprehended by police officers in Minneapolis, Minnesota, last Monday, and one of the officers pinned his knee to Floyd's neck as Floyd called out that he couldn't breathe.
		

What does the official autopsy report say about the cause of George Floyd's death?		
All this has caused controversy even in identifying the cause of death. According to an update on June 2, 8 a.m. ET: Hennepin County Medical Examiner’s office on Monday ruled George Floyd’s manner of death was a homicide and stated that he suffered “a cardiopulmonary arrest while being restrained by law enforcement officer(s).” The medical examiner’s office listed “arteriosclerotic and hypertensive heart disease,” “fentanyl intoxication” and “recent methamphetamine use” as “other significant conditions.” However, according to an independent autopsy, the cause of Floyd’s death was asphyxia.
		

What does the official autopsy report say about the cause of George Floyd's death?		
The autopsy listed other ""significant"" conditions, including hypertensive heart disease, fentanyl intoxication and recent methamphetamine use, the medical examiner said in a news release. Pathologists hired by Floyd's family said Monday that they had concluded that he died after blood and air flow was cut off to his brain, causing him to die by mechanical asphyxia. That autopsy, conducted by Dr. Michael Baden, the former chief medical examiner of New York City, found that Floyd had no underlying medical problems that caused or contributed to his death. Minneapolis police Officer Derek Chauvin was fired and arrested in Floyd's death. Video showing Chauvin pressing his knee into Floyd's neck for several minutes set off waves of sometimes violent protests that have rocked cities across the country.
		

What does the official autopsy report say about the cause of George Floyd's death?		
In response to one of Owens' claims — ""George Floyd at the time of his arrest was high on fentanyl and he was high on methamphetamine"" — as well as assertions by social media users who seemed to be in search of proof for why the MPD officers acted the way they did, here we unpack the results of Floyd's autopsy report. The claim is two-pronged: that Floyd had meth in his system and that he was high on the drug when Chauvin knelt on his neck, choking him. Firstly, on May 29, 2020, court documents revealed the Hennepin County Medical Examiner's investigation into Floyd's death showed ""no physical findings that support a diagnosis of traumatic asphyxiation,"" and that ""potential intoxicants"" and preexisting cardiovascular disease ""likely contributed to his death."" (Note: Coronary artery disease and hypertension typically increase patients' risk of stroke and heart attack over years, not minutes, and asphyxia, or suffocation, does not always leave physical signs, according to doctors.)

A tax on capital gains is a tax on the hard work and risk-taking people undertake to build their own wealth.” Biden cannot be trusted on the tax issue. As Vice President he broke his 2008 middle class tax pledge not to raise a single penny of tax on any American making less than $250,000 per year. And now he wants to re-impose the individual mandate tax of $695 to $2,085 which primarily hits households making less than $50,000 per year. He also said the first thing he would do in office is repeal the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Such repeal would impose a $2,000 annual income tax increase on a median income family of four, and a $1,300 annual income tax increase on a median income single parent with one child.

Joe Biden vows to ban oil and gas drilling if elected President, draws scorn from industry The latest Democrat Presidential debate between remaining nomination hopefuls former-Vice President Joe Biden and U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders saw Biden, the widely-regarded front-runner, take a harder stance on increase oil and gas regulation he would enact if elected President. Sanders long advocated for a cease in the use of hydraulic fracturing and a national transition away from fossil fuels to renewable resources such as wind and solar, but Biden’s stance was previously more moderate as he pushed for a reduction in subsidies to oil and gas companies. But at Sunday’s debate hosted by CNN and Univision, Biden called for a complete ban on oil and gas drilling on federal land – fracking or not.
		

Has President Joe Biden explicitly stated in any official speech, policy document, or credible news source that he intends to abolish the production of American oil, coal, shale, and natural gas?		
Sen. Biden: Absolutely. Absolutely we do. We call for setting hard targets, number one... Sen. Biden: Oh, on clean coal. My record, just take a look at the record. My record for 25 years has supported clean coal technology. A comment made in a rope line was taken out of context. I was talking about exporting that technology to China so when they burn their dirty coal, it won't be as dirty, it will be clean. But here's the bottom line, Gwen: How do we deal with global warming with continued addition to carbon emissions?
		

Has President Joe Biden explicitly stated in any official speech, policy document, or credible news source that he intends to abolish the production of American oil, coal, shale, and natural gas?		
The plan makes no mention of banning dirtier-burning coal or prohibiting fracking, a method of extracting oil and gas that triggered a natural gas boom in the United States over the last decade. The issue is especially sensitive in some key battleground states such as Pennsylvania. Some progressives have called for outright bans on the practice. Biden’s plan instead describes cutting back on burning oil, gas and coal, and doing better at capturing emissions, through more efficient vehicles, public transport, buildings and power plants. And instead of a ban on climate-damaging fossil fuels, he embraced carbon capture technologies to catch coal and petroleum pollution from power plant smokestacks.

Fracking: Unlike both Sanders and Warren, Biden isn’t calling for a ban on fracking, a drilling method widely used for natural-gas and oil extraction. He does support “aggressive methane pollution limits” and other tighter regulations on the sector. Feasibility and risks: By staking out a middle position on climate issues, Biden may be appealing to a broader coalition, including labor unions, which could be key for building necessary political support. Nuclear and carbon removal may be crucial tools in cutting emissions as rapidly and affordably as possible, including from the industrial sector.

Instead, Biden says he will work hard to point the federal ship of state toward climate action. He promises to implement a muscular set of executive orders on his first day in the White House. He will require public companies to disclose climate-incurred costs, deploy the federal government’s purchasing power on the side of clean energy, and restrict the release of the superpowerful greenhouse gas methane from oil and gas wells. He will also “require any federal permitting decision to consider the effects of greenhouse gas emissions and climate change”—a policy that could have led to a different outcome in the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipeline battles. Biden also promises to wring $1.7 trillion in investment from Congress, “the largest-ever investment in clean energy research and innovation.”

President Donald Trump signed an executive order Friday directing federal law enforcement agencies to prosecute people who damage federal monuments — and to withhold portions of federal funding to cities that don’t protect statues from demonstrators. The order marks the latest in Trump’s ongoing battle against protesters who have pushed for the removal of monuments and statues that memorialize Confederate leaders, and other figures who supported slavery, white supremacy, or colonialism. Several monuments have been torn down or removed in recent weeks amid protests against police brutality and racism, including statues of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee in Alabama and Confederate Gen. Albert Pike in Washington, DC. Trump responded to the removal of the statue in Washington by tweeting, “These people should be immediately arrested.

It’s unclear, however, to what extent the administration could actually enforce this provision. Trump announced the edict on Twitter, hours after tweeting a poster from the FBI seeking information about 15 people alleged to have been involved in attempting to tear down a statue of Andrew Jackson near the White House on Monday night, and calling for all 15 to face “10 year prison sentences!” The statues of Confederates and others who advanced white supremacist ideals have become a campaign issue for the president as he re-engages with his reelection campaign.

But despite what’s on paper, Trump has made it clear during speeches, rallies and tweets that he is fully opposed to defunding the police, instead embracing police unions and police officers as he did during his 2016 campaign. “We will never, ever defund our police. OK? That I can tell you. We are not defunding police,” Trump said during an event in Florida on July 10. On Friday, when Biden said Trump was actually the candidate who was more likely to cut police funding based on the 2021 proposed budget, Trump’s 2020 campaign fired back with a critique of Biden’s own record. “Joe Biden doesn’t have a leg to stand on regarding police funding,” Trump campaign communications director Tim Murtaugh said in a statement to ABC News.
		

Did Joe Biden publicly express support for cutting police funding in a manner consistent with Donald Trump's statement?		
When asked for evidence of his claims that Biden wants to cut funding to the police in a July interview with Fox News anchor Chris Wallace, Trump incorrectly claimed it was a component of the unity task force Biden created with Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders. “It says nothing about defunding the police,” Wallace correctly told Trump during the interview. Despite the squabbling, both candidates have clearly stated they do not agree with calls to defund the policeDespite their policy differences, neither Trump nor Biden have shown any explicit support for defunding the police. While Biden has made efforts to compromise with progressive Democrats and devote more funding for services that would go beyond physical protection, he has not fully satisfied their calls for more reform.

“President Trump says that you want to defund the police. Do you?” asked ""Good Morning America"" co-anchor Robin Roberts in the interview conducted in Wilmington, Delaware. “No I don’t,” Biden responded, laughing. “By the way, he proposes cutting a half a billion dollars of local police support.” Biden then detailed his support for increasing funding for local police forces and deploying more psychologists and social workers in police work. He contrasted his plan with Trump’s action in office: “So the only guy that actually put in a bill to actually defund the police is Donald Trump,” Biden said.

In response to President Donald Trump’s continued claims that Democratic nominee Joe Biden supports defunding the police, a goal of the Black Lives Matter movement, Biden asserted in an interview with ABC News on Friday that it’s instead Trump who actually supports legislation that would do that.

They are provided as part of the historical record.] President Trump is correct in his assessment that Joe Biden would defund the police. The media is bending over backwards to let Biden get away with playing with synonyms to give him a pass. He has clearly stated that he would ""Yes! Absolutely!"" redirect funding away from police to other budget areas. This is cutting, or defunding, the police by any definition. Further, the proposed destruction of qualified immunity for police in the Biden-Sanders platform would financially eviscerate local police departments in communities across the United States, effectively bankrupting and destroying them.

Joe Biden said in an interview Wednesday that some funding should “absolutely” be redirected from police, amid calls from some in his party to ""defund the police"" in the wake of the protests across the country. Biden's campaign has said he does not support defunding the police. But in a Now This interview with activist Ady Barkan, the presumptive Democratic nominee said that police forces don’t need surplus military equipment, saying this is what leads them to “become the enemy” in a community. “But do we agree that we can redirect some of the [police] funding?” Barkan asked Biden. “Yes, absolutely,” said the former vice president.

Then again, police could also receive more funding to implement changes in policing, under Biden’s approach. When we asked the Biden campaign about the issue, spokesman Andrew Bates sent us a statement saying that Biden opposes defunding the police but supports changes. The statement also says Biden supports more money for certain initiatives that would strengthen the relationship between the police and the community and for body-worn cameras.

In a segment of the interview that didn’t appear on YouTube, Biden said he supports reforms, but “that’s not the same as getting rid of or defunding all the police.” (The Washington Post Fact Checker obtained audio of the full conversation.)

But the question did not directly ask if coverage would be free. Buttigieg specifically said people would buy the coverage, and that it was ""not about a handout.""

A Trump re-election campaign ad said Democratic presidential candidates ""support giving illegal immigrants free healthcare at our expense."" This is misleading.

Emergency health services and safety-net clinics are already available to undocumented immigrants, which Biden had advocated for before. In summary, even though Biden did state that the U.S. had an obligation to ensure immigrants received health care, his views were largely misrepresented and did not reflect his current policy.

And those yearly budgets are still in the billions. As we said, Trump gets to “trillion” by adding together several years.

He made that assertion on June 25 when speaking at a shipbuilding company in Wisconsin. “We’ve totally rebuilt the military — $2.5 trillion,” Trump said, going on to talk about a contract awarded to that shipbuilding company, Fincantieri Marinette Marine, “to build the next generation of guided missile frigates for the United States Navy.”

At times, he mentions the figure for the defense budgets without stipulating what specifically the money bought. “I’ve rebuilt our military. I spent two and a half trillion dollars. Nobody else did,” he told Fox News on June 11. (As we explained, Obama did indeed approve budgets totaling more than that.)
		

Can you provide a reliable source or a specific date when Donald Trump made the statement about spending nearly $2.5 trillion on rebuilding the military?		
President Donald Trump has falsely claimed his administration invested “$2.5 trillion in all of the greatest equipment in the world” for the military. That’s approximately the total for defense budgets from 2017 to 2020, but the cost of purchasing new military equipment was 20% of that. It’s true the Defense Department budgets passed under Trump — which total $2.9 trillion, in inflation-adjusted dollars, actually — have been larger than they were in the latter years of his predecessor. In the last four years under then-President Barack Obama, the defense budgets, in inflation-adjusted dollars, totaled $2.7 trillion, but the budgets in Obama’s first four years were nearly $3.3 trillion.
		

Can you provide a reliable source or a specific date when Donald Trump made the statement about spending nearly $2.5 trillion on rebuilding the military?		
Trump then mentioned missiles, rockets and tanks, saying: “What we had were great people in the military, but they weren’t given the right equipment, so now they are. Two and a half trillion dollars. … We’ve invested the $2.5 trillion in all of the greatest equipment in the world, and it’s all made here, right in the USA.” Procurement — as in buying equipment — made up 20.3% of those 2017-2020 defense budgets, or $590.7 billion. (That’s in constant — inflation-adjusted — 2021 dollars, per the Defense Department report.)
		

Can you provide a reliable source or a specific date when Donald Trump made the statement about spending nearly $2.5 trillion on rebuilding the military?		
On occasion, Trump has emphasized the “trillion,” as he did in a speech at West Point on June 13: “[W]e have invested over 2 trillion — trillion; that’s with a ‘T’ — dollars in the most powerful fighting force, by far, on the planet Earth.” On May 22, he falsely claimed military funding “used to be ‘million.’ And then, about 10 years ago, you started hearing ‘billion.’ And now you’re starting to hear ‘trillion,’ right?” That’s wrong. The defense budget has been in the billions each year dating back to 1948 (as far as the Defense Department tables go).
		

Can you provide a reliable source or a specific date when Donald Trump made the statement about spending nearly $2.5 trillion on rebuilding the military?		
But other times, he has made the false claim about all of the funding going for equipment, or “new planes, ships, submarines, tanks, missiles, rockets — anything you can think of.” Todd Harrison, director of defense budget analysis at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told us when Trump has claimed $2-plus trillion was spent on military equipment, that’s “absolutely untrue.” “What we spend on military equipment is a fraction of the defense budget,” Harrison said. If we wanted to be generous, Harrison said, we could include the defense budget’s “research, development, test, and evaluation” category, which pays for the development of technology, as part of military equipment.
		

Can you provide a reliable source or a specific date when Donald Trump made the statement about spending nearly $2.5 trillion on rebuilding the military?		
Obama’s second-term budgets were subject to spending caps under the Budget Control Act of 2011, an effort to lower federal deficits. Beginning in fiscal 2013, Congress has raised those caps every year, according to a Congressional Research Service report, and there have been much larger cap increases in the last three defense budgets signed by Trump. In looking solely at procurement, the budgets for 2017-2020 are 24.8% larger than those in 2013-2016 but 5.8% lower than the 2009-2012 budgets, in inflation-adjusted figures. We previously wrote about Trump’s false claims that the defense budgets he signed showed “record” levels of spending.
		

Can you provide a reliable source or a specific date when Donald Trump made the statement about spending nearly $2.5 trillion on rebuilding the military?		
Those are the budget authority figures — the amounts Congress appropriated — from the Defense Department comptroller’s budget report released this year. (Note: The fiscal 2009 defense budget was signed by then-President George W. Bush four months before Obama took office. The fiscal 2017 budget, which began on Oct. 1, 2016, when Obama was still in office, was signed by Trump.) So, in context, the amount Trump is touting isn’t all that unusual.
		

Can you provide a reliable source or a specific date when Donald Trump made the statement about spending nearly $2.5 trillion on rebuilding the military?		
That category plus procurement would total 33.5% of the last four defense budgets. The largest defense budget category is operation and maintenance, which made up 40.2% of the 2017-2020 budgets, followed by military personnel, which was 22.6% of those budgets. But when the president hasn’t been as specific, his $2.5 trillion claim could be interpreted to refer to what the U.S. spends in total on defense, and “that’s about right,” Harrison said. “No president can claim credit or get the blame for military spending all on their own,” he added, noting that Congress passes appropriation bills that the president then signs into law.
		

Can you provide a reliable source or a specific date when Donald Trump made the statement about spending nearly $2.5 trillion on rebuilding the military?		
When adjusted for inflation, the defense budgets for fiscal 2007 through 2012 were all larger than the budgets signed by Trump, according to the Defense Department figures.

Alex Azar, president of HHS, said in a press release that the orders “will deliver billions of dollars in discounts directly to patients at the pharmacy counter, safe low-cost imported drugs for Americans, the best deals for America on highly expensive drugs, and direct discounts passed on to patients on important drugs from community health centers.”

This time, Trump referenced two different drug-pricing executive orders.

There was a time when state and local governments could work out deals with Washington. But as the pandemic struggle illustrates, the glory days of big intergovernmental initiatives have ebbed away. Amid the unseemly brawl about continuing unemployment benefits for those whose lives have been upended by COVID-19, an unsettling truth has emerged: State and local governments, which not that long ago functioned as partners with Washington in the nation's federal system, have increasingly become supplicants. There's a searing irony in that fact, because governors of both parties have been in the lead of the nation's response to the coronavirus pandemic.

The Spanish war and other events in 1936-37 turned the scale and thereafter I knew where I stood. Every line of serious work that I have written since 1936 has been written, directly or indirectly, against totalitarianism and for democratic socialism, as I understand it. It seems to me nonsense, in a period like our own, to think that one can avoid writing of such subjects. Everyone writes of them in one guise or another. It is simply a question of which side one takes and what approach one follows.

Strongly influenced by the success of the Bolshevik Revolution, American socialists and radicals met in Chicago in 1919 to organize an American Communist party. But the Americans were so divided they created two parties instead. One group consisted primarily of relatively recent Russian and East European immigrants, who emphasized adherence to Marxist orthodoxy and proletarian revolution. The other group, dominated by native-born, somewhat more pragmatic American radicals, sought mass influence. Such conflicting goals combined with the discrepancy between Communist doctrine and American reality, kept the Communist movement in the United States a small sectarian movement.

If the officer happened to be in the car, the radio traffic was nonstop.” Some on social media say he goes by the name Kyle Lewis. That is his mother’s last name, but court records use Kyle Rittenhouse.

An eyewitness told Heavy she saw that scene directly. However, Rittenhouse was able to leave the area. When asked how that could have happened, Kenosha County Sheriff Dave Beth said in a news conference that an officer may not have been aware what exactly was going on, saying, “There was screaming, there’s hollering, there’s chanting, there’s a squad car running, there’s (police vehicles) idling.

Kenosha Shooting: Video Shows Suspected Gunman Kyle Rittenhouse Being Allowed To Leave Scene KENOSHA, Wis. (CBS) -- The violence that erupted in Kenosha and ended up leaving two people dead and a third injured overnight Tuesday into Wednesday unfolded on social media. CBS 2's Chris Tye pieced together dozens of eyewitness videos. Stitch together those videos of accused murder suspect Kyle Rittenhouse, 17, of Antioch, and a narrative emerges. The shooting took place around 11:45 p.m. Tuesday near 63rd Street and Sheridan Road in Kenosha, amid a third night of unrest following the police shooting of 29-year-old Jacob Blake.

But after the 17-year-old from Antioch was accused of shooting two people to death Tuesday night and wounding another amid the ongoing unrest in Kenosha, Wisconsin, he’s found himself firmly on the other end of the law. Antioch police reported Wednesday that Rittenhouse was arrested on suspicion of first-degree intentional homicide after he allegedly opened fire during a protest that erupted in the wake of the police shooting of Jacob Blake. Rittenhouse remains held in Lake County awaiting an extradition hearing Friday.

Warning: Graphic descriptions and video.

The suspect was identified as Kyle Rittenhouse, of Lake County, Illinois. Prosecutors in Lake County filed the charges at noon Wednesday, and labelled him a fugitive who “fled the state of Wisconsin with intent to avoid prosecution for that offense.” Tuesday was the third consecutive night of angry protests in Kenosha since police shot Jacob Blake, a Black man, leaving him paralyzed. Rittenhouse, clad in a green t-shirt, a cap emblazoned with an American flag, and carrying an assault rifle, was seen on video at various points of the night.

490,EU Trade Commissioner resigned after being accused of violating COVID-19 health rules in Ireland,"Did the EU Trade Commissioner officially resign, and were they accused of violating COVID-19 health rules specifically in Ireland?		
This evening I have tendered my resignation as EU Trade Commissioner to the President of the EU Commission, Dr Ursula von der Leyen. It was becoming increasingly clear that the controversy concerning my recent visit to Ireland was becoming a distraction from my work as an EU Commissioner and would undermine my work in the key months ahead. I deeply regret that my trip to Ireland – the country that I have been so proud to represent as a public servant for most of my adult life - caused such concern, unease and upset. I have always tried to comply with all relevant COVID-19 Regulations in Ireland and had understood that I had met with all relevant public health Guidelines, particularly following confirmation of a negative COVID-19 test.
		

Did the EU Trade Commissioner officially resign, and were they accused of violating COVID-19 health rules specifically in Ireland?		
I reiterate my heartfelt apology to the Irish people for the mistakes I made during my visit. The Irish people have made incredible efforts to contain the coronavirus, and the European Commission will continue to support you, and all EU Member States, in defeating this terrible pandemic. Let me say from the heart that I fully appreciate and recognise the challenge presented by the COVID-19 pandemic to our society and the global economy. As European Trade Commissioner, I have been at the frontline of the European Union’s response to the crisis. I recognise and appreciate the devastating impact of Covid-19 on individuals and families, and I fully understand their sense of hurt and anger when they feel that those in public service do not meet the standards expected of them.
		

Did the EU Trade Commissioner officially resign, and were they accused of violating COVID-19 health rules specifically in Ireland?		
It is important to state that I did not break any law. As a public representative I should have been more rigorous in my adherence to the Covid regulations. It has been the honour of my life to serve as European Commissioner, first in Agriculture and Rural Development and then in Trade. I believe the project of European Union is our shared continent’s crowning achievement: a force for peace and prosperity the likes of which the world has never seen. I also believe that Ireland’s destiny is deeply European, and that our small, proud, open nation will continue to play an inspiring and proactive role at the heart of the EU.

Asked whether sticking to such a process wouldn't harm the economies of all EU members, Ms Malmstrom replied: ""Yes, but the vote was very clear."" She said she was ""saddened"" that the UK - which has traditionally defended the principle of free trade - is leaving the EU. Under EU law, the bloc cannot negotiate a separate trade deal with one of its own members, hence the commissioner's insistence that the UK must first leave. It is also against EU law for a member to negotiate its own trade deals with outsiders, which means the UK cannot start doing this until after it has left the EU.
		

Did the EU Trade Commissioner officially resign, and were they accused of violating COVID-19 health rules specifically in Ireland?

I remain convinced that at a time when the global economy faces significant challenges and turbulences, the importance of the EU as a global leader remains paramount. It has been my priority as EU Trade Commissioner to strengthen this global leadership role in trade, and to boost Europe’s capacity to protect itself from unfair trading practices. The EU must remain at the heart of the multilateral system of open, fair and rules-based trade, and continue pursuing a positive reform agenda.

Brexit also represents a significant challenge for the EU and for Ireland in particular for which I have been centrally involved from the outset.

EU and UK citizens and businesses deserve nothing less.

""There are actually two negotiations. First you exit, and then you negotiate the new relationship, whatever that is,"" she said. ""The referendum - which of course we take note of and respect - has no legal effect. First there has to be notification, which the next prime minister will do, I hope swiftly. There is concern in the City that having to do business for years under WTO rules could be disastrous for the UK's service industries.

Fact-check: Does Joe Biden want to end school choice? This piece was originally published on PolitiFact.com on July 17, 2020 Donald Trump: “Joe Biden wants to end school choice.” Here’s why: On President Donald Trump’s list of ""really bad"" ideas in the Biden-Sanders unity platform, one involved school choice.
		

Has Joe Biden publicly stated or proposed specific policies aimed at ending school choice programs during his presidency or candidacy?		
""Joe Biden opposes the Trump/(Betsy) DeVos conception of ‘school choice,’ which is private school vouchers that would destroy our public schools. He's also against for-profit and low-performing charter schools, and believes in holding all charter schools accountable. He does not oppose districts letting parents choose to send their children to public magnet schools, high-performing public charters or traditional public schools."" As part of a broader education policy outlined on his website, Biden calls for nearly tripling the Title 1 funding for aid to schools serving lower income neighborhoods and raising teacher pay.
		

Has Joe Biden publicly stated or proposed specific policies aimed at ending school choice programs during his presidency or candidacy?		
So when Trump says Biden opposes school choice, it’s true that he opposes vouchers for private schools. According to a Biden campaign official, “Joe Biden opposes the Trump/Devos conception of ‘school choice,’ which is private school vouchers that would destroy our public schools. He’s also against for-profit and low-performing charter schools, and believes in holding all charter schools accountable. He does not oppose districts letting parents choose to send their children to public magnet schools, high-performing public charters, or traditional public schools.”

Has Joe Biden publicly stated or proposed specific policies aimed at ending school choice programs during his presidency or candidacy?		
In a series of virtual tele-rallies, President Donald Trump repeatedly distorted Joe Biden’s position on education, claiming the former vice president wants to “end school choice” and “abolish charter schools.” Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, opposes federal funding going to “for-profit charter schools,” but schools managed by for-profit companies make up only a fraction of charter schools. And while Biden opposes vouchers for private school tuition — the ultimate in school choice for some — he does not oppose students choosing between public schools, magnet schools and high-performing charter schools. Trump’s attack on Biden was gleaned from policy recommendations drafted by Biden and his former rival for the Democratic presidential nomination, Sen. Bernie Sanders.
		

Has Joe Biden publicly stated or proposed specific policies aimed at ending school choice programs during his presidency or candidacy?		
More: Fact check: Democrats have condemned violence linked to BLM, anti-fascist protests The fundamental assertion here is that Biden wants to ban school choice. That’s not a new claim. And it’s not exactly accurate. PolitiFact rated Mostly False a Trump claim that Biden “wants to end school choice.” EdChoice, an advocacy group that says it aims ""to advance educational freedom and choice,"" says that term can include private school vouchers as well as charter schools and specialized “magnet” schools that, for instance, may focus on math and science or the arts.
		

Has Joe Biden publicly stated or proposed specific policies aimed at ending school choice programs during his presidency or candidacy?		
And here in Wisconsin, the birthplace of the school choice movement in America, you deserve to know — (applause) — Joe Biden would take away the right of parents to choose where their children go to school — public, private, or parochial. So you need to tell your neighbors and friends: Joe Biden wants to end school choice. Those are the facts. But it’s not just been about our economy and about defending American jobs and health and educational opportunities. I couldn’t be more proud to be Vice President to a President who has stood without apology for the sanctity of human life.

Has Joe Biden publicly stated or proposed specific policies aimed at ending school choice programs during his presidency or candidacy?		
Joe Biden’s campaign didn’t return a request for comment. The former vice president isn’t the only 2020 candidate to oppose school choice despite choosing a private education for their own child. (RELATED: Analysis: Elizabeth Warren Has A Credibility Problem) Democratic Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren has vowed to crack down on school choice if elected, even though she chose to send her son, Alexander Warren, to an elite private school. Elizabeth Warren also falsely denied sending her son to private school when pro-school choice activists asked about it after a campaign event in November.
		

Has Joe Biden publicly stated or proposed specific policies aimed at ending school choice programs during his presidency or candidacy?		
We should not waste the scarce resources that our public schools badly need. In addition, he will ensure that charter schools are held to the same levels of accountability and transparency as traditional public schools.” The campaign official added that Biden “does not oppose districts letting parents choose to send their children to … high-performing public charters.” As for Trump’s claim that Biden opposes school choice, as the document makes clear, Biden opposes “private school vouchers and other policies that divert taxpayer–funded resources away from the public school system.” The unity task force recommendations specifically seek to discontinue federal funding for the Opportunity Scholarship Program, a program offered only in Washington, D.C., that in 2019 provided $17.5 million for private school vouchers that predominantly went to Black students.

Biden’s plan to address climate change calls for the United States to zero out its greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 while helping the workers and communities that may suffer job losses in the switch to clean energy. Trump, meanwhile, has no published plan to deal with climate change. He has, however, relaxed environmental regulations around mining and drilling in the United States to boost US fossil fuel production. Activists have pushed presidential contenders to address fracking — which involves pumping highly pressurized water, sand, and other chemicals into a rock formation to create fractures that can release trapped oil and gas — because it has radically reshaped the US economic, energy, political, and environmental landscape. It’s turned the United States into the largest oil producer in the world. It helped pull the country out of a recession.
		

What specific policies or actions did President Donald Trump implement to achieve energy independence for the United States, and what are the current energy policies and goals of President Joe Biden regarding fossil fuels and fracking?		
“Just to clarify, would there be any place for fossil fuels, including coal and fracking, in a Biden administration?” “No, we would — we would work it out. We would make sure it's eliminated and no more subsidies for either one of those, either — any fossil fuel,” Biden said in response. More: In California: A race to block new drilling and fracking It’s unclear what Biden meant by “work it out” or when the elimination would occur, but the Biden campaign said he does not want to ban fracking.

""He was against fracking. He said it. I will show that to you tomorrow. ‘I am against fracking’, until he got the nomination, went to Pennsylvania than he said — You know what, Pennsylvania? He'll be against it very soon because his party is totally against it,"" Trump said, according to a transcript. But Biden denied any plans to ban fracking. The Democratic nominee said he will introduce policies to capture emissions from fracking as part of his clean energy plan. ""I do rule out banning fracking because the answer we need — we need other industries to transition to get to, ultimately, a complete zero emissions by 2025,"" Biden said.
		

What specific policies or actions did President Donald Trump implement to achieve energy independence for the United States, and what are the current energy policies and goals of President Joe Biden regarding fossil fuels and fracking?		
The issue is politically sensitive in some key battleground states such as Pennsylvania, and Biden limited his opposition to new fracking permits during the primary. Biden’s new plan instead describes easing out burning oil, gas and coal through more efficient vehicles, public transport, buildings and power plants. And instead of a ban on climate-damaging fossil fuels, he talks about carbon capture technologies to catch coal and petroleum pollution from power plant smokestacks. Biden also embraces nuclear power, unlike some of his Democratic primary opponents. He calls for pumping up research on still-developing power technologies like hydrogen power and grid-size storage to stash power from solar and wind, overcoming a key drawback of those carbon-free energy sources now.
		

What specific policies or actions did President Donald Trump implement to achieve energy independence for the United States, and what are the current energy policies and goals of President Joe Biden regarding fossil fuels and fracking?		
The plan says Biden will provide incentives for the development and use of carbon capture technology, and work to hold polluters financially accountable. It also says Biden will help fossil fuel workers, such as coal miners and power plant operators, make the move to clean energy jobs. But, during the transition, the U.S. would continue to rely on fossil fuels for at least some of its energy. Notably, Biden’s campaign has said he would continue to largely allow fracking, formally known as hydraulic fracturing, a drilling technique used to extract oil and natural gas, which are fossil fuels, from rock formations underground.

Fact Check: Joe Biden wants to eliminate new fracking permits, not all fracking The claim that presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden wants to eliminate fracking has been made for much of the presidential campaign. This summer, it was made in a post on Facebook and is similar to an ad by America First Action, a pro-Trump Political Action Committee. It includes a video of Biden answering a question in a primary debate and a claim that Biden could cost Pennsylvania more than 600,000 jobs.

Biden’s energy plan and other comments he has made shed light on his plans. Biden’s website has a lengthy description of his climate proposal, which is called “Joe’s Plan for a Clean Energy Revolution and Environmental Justice.” The plan includes a call for 100% clean energy and net-zero emissions by 2050, as well as a proposal to ban on new oil and gas permits on public lands and waters. Biden echoed that position at a CNN town hall in September 2019, after saying that he doesn’t support a nationwide fracking ban.

Joe Biden vows to ban oil and gas drilling if elected President, draws scorn from industry The latest Democrat Presidential debate between remaining nomination hopefuls former-Vice President Joe Biden and U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders saw Biden, the widely-regarded front-runner, take a harder stance on increase oil and gas regulation he would enact if elected President. Sanders long advocated for a cease in the use of hydraulic fracturing and a national transition away from fossil fuels to renewable resources such as wind and solar, but Biden’s stance was previously more moderate as he pushed for a reduction in subsidies to oil and gas companies. But at Sunday’s debate hosted by CNN and Univision, Biden called for a complete ban on oil and gas drilling on federal land – fracking or not.

Biden's running mate, Sen. Kamala Harris told reporters during a campaign stop in Atlanta on Friday that Biden wouldn’t ban fracking but would seek to eliminate subsidies for fossil fuels. “Let's be really clear about this. Joe Biden is not going to ban fracking. He is going to deal with the oil subsidies. But that's, you know, the president likes to put everything out of context. But let's be clear: What Joe was talking about was banning subsidies, but he will not ban fracking,” Harris said of Trump's debate rhetoric. During an interview in April, Biden told KDKA television in Pittsburgh that he would not shut down the fracking industry.

Mr. Trump issued his first travel restrictions related to the virus on Jan. 31, one day after the World Health Organization declared the outbreak a global health emergency. In a presidential proclamation, he barred foreign nationals from entering the country if they had been in China during the prior two weeks. The order exempted American citizens, green-card holders and their noncitizen relatives — exceptions roundly recognized as necessary to allow residents to return home and prevent families from being separated. It did not apply to flights from Hong Kong and Macau.

Thousands of them flew directly from Wuhan, the center of the coronavirus outbreak, as American public health officials were only beginning to assess the risks to the United States. Flights continued this past week, the data show, with passengers traveling from Beijing to Los Angeles, San Francisco and New York, under rules that exempt Americans and some others from the clampdown that took effect on Feb. 2. In all, 279 flights from China have arrived in the United States since then, and screening procedures have been uneven, interviews show. Mr. Trump has repeatedly suggested that his travel measures impeded the virus’s spread in the United States.

Since then, nearly 40,000 Americans and other authorized travelers have made the trip, some this past week and many with spotty screening. Since Chinese officials disclosed the outbreak of a mysterious pneumonialike illness to international health officials on New Year’s Eve, at least 430,000 people have arrived in the United States on direct flights from China, including nearly 40,000 in the two months after President Trump imposed restrictions on such travel, according to an analysis of data collected in both countries. The bulk of the passengers, who were of multiple nationalities, arrived in January, at airports in Los Angeles, San Francisco, New York, Chicago, Seattle, Newark and Detroit.

Many infectious-disease experts suspect that the virus had been spreading undetected for weeks after the first American case was confirmed, in Washington State, on Jan. 20, and that it had continued to be introduced.

What the candidate positions (including Trump) are on the Green New Deal The Democratic debate over environmental issues has centered heavily around the Green New Deal, a plan to rapidly switch to clean energy to head off the worst projected effects of climate change. However, unlike other ideas that Democrats are discussing on the campaign trail, the Green New Deal is not a clear policy proposal in and of itself. Instead, it refers to a 14-page resolution sponsored by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and Sen. Edward Markey, D-Mass., that lays out a series of broad goals and guiding principles and then leaves it to lawmakers to figure out how to meet them.
		

Is the Democratic Party, under Joe Biden's leadership, officially endorsing the Green New Deal, and does this plan specifically propose the banning of animal agriculture and the elimination of gas-powered cars?		
Democratic candidates have put out a wide range of environmental plans so far, some of which cite the Green New Deal as an influence, that often have overlapping features. Many of the candidates have released proposals for a trillion-dollar-plus investment in energy infrastructure, like electric car charging stations and building upgrades, as well as research into new technology, like carbon capture or cheaper solar power, and funds to help displaced workers. Plans often include funding to help communities prepare for future natural disasters as well. Among the candidates who have put out plans along these lines are former Vice President Joe Biden, Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Sen. Kamala Harris of California, Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey, South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, former Rep. Beto O’Rourke, and businessman Andrew Yang.
		

Is the Democratic Party, under Joe Biden's leadership, officially endorsing the Green New Deal, and does this plan specifically propose the banning of animal agriculture and the elimination of gas-powered cars?		
Democratic presidential candidates backing the Green New Deal have released their own environmental plans, and there’s no sign of one comprehensive piece of legislation around the corner that addresses every aspect of the resolution. The Green New Deal emerged out of grassroots-activist circles on the left and gained newfound attention in late 2018, thanks to a series of protests in Washington and a public push from the newly elected Ocasio-Cortez. Advocates have made the case that governments have grown complacent in the face of increasingly dire evidence from scientists that the world needs to move rapidly toward clean energy. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a United Nations working group of scientists from around the world, warned in a report last year that nations needed to take “unprecedented” action to reach net-zero emissions of carbon dioxide emissions by 2050 to head off a global 1.5 degree Celsius increase in temperature.
		

Is the Democratic Party, under Joe Biden's leadership, officially endorsing the Green New Deal, and does this plan specifically propose the banning of animal agriculture and the elimination of gas-powered cars?		
- The Green New Deal is not a specific policy proposal, but rather a general set of goals. - It seeks to get the world to net-zero emissions by 2050 and ideally even sooner in the United States. - It goes beyond the environment and climate change to call for universal health care and affordable housing, among other goals. - Not all Democratic presidential candidates back the Green New Deal, with some arguing it boxes them in too much on specifics, while many Republicans, including the president, say it’s not affordable and could cost tens of trillions of dollars if fully implemented.

We will expand popular, voluntary programs for sustainable and regenerative agricultural practices that help protect clean air and water and support wildlife habitats, including for threatened pollinators. Democrats will invest in research and development to support climate-resilient, sustainable, low-carbon, and organic agricultural methods. America's farmworkers are essential to our economy, our communities, and our security. We will enforce labor and environmental protections for farmworkers, including overtime and safety rules protecting workers from exposure to pesticides and extreme heat, and ensure farmworkers are able to exercise their right to bargain collectively. Democrats will empower small and mid-size family farms by tackling market concentration in agriculture, including by strengthening enforcement of the Sherman and Clayton Antitrust Acts and the Packers and Stockyards Act.
		

Is the Democratic Party, under Joe Biden's leadership, officially endorsing the Green New Deal, and does this plan specifically propose the banning of animal agriculture and the elimination of gas-powered cars?		
While the dominant stance in the Republican Party has been to oppose government efforts to address climate change, some GOP politicians have suggested that a carbon tax (Congressman John Delaney’s own bill has one Republican co-sponsor) could theoretically attract bipartisan support as an alternative to the Green New Deal. The Green New Deal resolution doesn’t rule out a carbon tax or other price on emissions, but some activists supporting it are skeptical of the concept. Some Democrats, especially in states with significant fossil fuel industries, have called for more research into technologies that offset the effects of their pollution. Presidential candidates, including Rep. Tim Ryan of Ohio, have pushed for more natural gas production, arguing it can replace dirtier fuels like coal while renewable energy gets off the ground.
		

Is the Democratic Party, under Joe Biden's leadership, officially endorsing the Green New Deal, and does this plan specifically propose the banning of animal agriculture and the elimination of gas-powered cars?		
Another common objection is that the Green New Deal needlessly complicates the debate around climate change policy by linking it to other issues like health care and a jobs guarantee. Others have more targeted concerns. The resolution is neutral on whether nuclear power should be part of the transition from fossil fuels, for example, and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii, said she didn’t sign on in part because she opposed nuclear power. Some critics in both parties have argued the Green New Deal places too much emphasis on direct government investment and should instead give the private sector incentives to change on its own. Democratic presidential candidate John Delaney, among others, has called for a tax on carbon emissions to encourage the move toward renewable energy.
		

Is the Democratic Party, under Joe Biden's leadership, officially endorsing the Green New Deal, and does this plan specifically propose the banning of animal agriculture and the elimination of gas-powered cars?		
Over the longer span of 10 years, US renewable energy consumption has grown at a faster rate than Germany, Japan and Spain, countries which are viewed as being much more progressive on climate initiatives globally. All of this goes to show that in spite of public statements, the market remains king in the US. Politicians provide the rhetoric, but economic fundamentals, such as the rapid cost reduction of fracking in a high oil price world under Obama, and the continued decline in the cost of renewable energy under Trump, are far more important in charting industrial realities in the US. Unlike previous candidates, Joe Biden’s campaign has put climate policy right at the heart of his manifesto. Building upon policies outlined in the green new deal put together by the progressive wing of the Democratic party last year, Biden wants to make clean energy a key part of the country’s post Covid-19 economic rebuild.
		

Is the Democratic Party, under Joe Biden's leadership, officially endorsing the Green New Deal, and does this plan specifically propose the banning of animal agriculture and the elimination of gas-powered cars?		
Democrats believe farmers should have the right to repair their own farming equipment, rather than being forced to rely on large corporations for even the simplest fixes. And we will expand domestic markets for family farmers and ranchers by developing and growing regional food systems to deliver fresh, American-grown produce to schools, hospitals, Department of Defense installations, and other major public institutions, so small, mid-size, and traditional farmers can stay competitive. Democrats will partner with America's farmers, ranchers, and foresters to make the U.S. agriculture sector the first in the world to achieve net-zero emissions, which will spark a revolution in agriculture and open up new revenue streams for farmers in energy and waste products, and grow bio-based manufacturing jobs. We will grow the nation's biofuels manufacturing sector, including by strengthening the Renewable Fuel Standard, supporting E15 blends, and supporting research, development, and deployment of advanced biofuels.
		

Is the Democratic Party, under Joe Biden's leadership, officially endorsing the Green New Deal, and does this plan specifically propose the banning of animal agriculture and the elimination of gas-powered cars?		
The plans differ in scale. Sander's, the largest by far, proposes $16 trillion in spending, paid for in part by fees on fossil fuel companies. Warren's plan calls for $3 trillion in federal investment over ten years, Biden calls for $1.7 trillion, and O'Rourke calls for $1.5 trillion, and they predict their plans would mobilize even larger contributions from the private sector. Every Democratic candidate has pledged to rejoin the Paris Climate agreement, with some saying they would try to set its targets even higher. In general, they’ve also pledged to pursue rules that would require power plants, buildings, and vehicles to slash pollution, jumping off efforts by President Barack Obama that Trump halted or reversed and taking them further.

Under President Trump, we will stand with those who stand on the Thin Blue Line, and we're not going to defund the police – not now, not ever. My fellow Americans, we are passing through a time of testing. Soon, we will come to a time for choosing. Joe Biden has referred to himself as a ""transition candidate."" But many are asking: A transition to what?
		

What are Joe Biden's official policies or statements regarding immigration reform, including border security, sanctuary cities, legal representation for immigrants, and healthcare access for undocumented individuals?		
Thank you Senator Sanders. Vice President Biden, you opposed sanctuary cities as a Presidential candidate in 2007, where do you stand now? Should undocumented immigrants arrested by local police be turned over to immigration officials? Of course not. Look… And one of the things that goes on when you have that process, is that not only the psychological terror, and I’ve talked to these kids, kids are scared to death in America when they come home from school that their mom or dad may not be there, may be deported. What we need to do is to end, and I will end this on day one, the ICE raids that have been so harmful to so many people.

They say, no, they don't say that. They say you're the most hated American in China, because of their human rights violations, their trade policy, their proliferation of weapons and that. PELOSI: But -- so, I have no -- take no criticism for saying this. PELOSI: But the Chinese, they -- what they said is, China would prefer Joe Biden. Whether they do -- that's their conclusion, that they would prefer Joe Biden. Russia is actively, 24/7 interfering in our election. They did so in 2016, and they are doing so now.

BASH: Can you lean into it a little bit more, for the sake of voters wondering what's going on? PELOSI: Well, I can't divulge information that is classified. That's why we want them to do it. But I will say this, that, for some reason, they have tried to have some equivalence. I take second place to no one on my criticism of China for over 30 years. They have -- I have said to my staff the other day, they say I'm the most unliked American in China -- disliked American in China.

Has Nancy Pelosi publicly stated that China would prefer Joe Biden over another candidate? If so, can you provide a source or context for this statement?		
The team has specifically focused on the semantics of the statement as it relates to the former vice president, noting that Russia is unambiguously looking to “denigrate” Biden while China simply “prefers” a Trump defeat. Evanina came under fire from Democratic leaders last month when he last issued a warning about efforts by Russia, China and Iran to interfere in the November election. Lawmakers claimed his statement did not go “nearly far enough” in providing the American public with information about foreign attempts to influence the election. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and House Intelligence Committee chair Adam Schiff on Friday said Evanina’s statement improves on the last by including more detail, but “still treats three actors of differing intent and capability as equal threats to our democratic elections.”

U.S. intelligence shows Russia is trying to ""denigrate"" Biden, while China prefers Trump lose The U.S. intelligence community has assessed that Russia is actively seeking to ""denigrate"" presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden and that some actors linked to the Kremlin are trying to boost President Trump's candidacy ahead of the 2020 presidential election, according to the country's top election security official. In an unprecedented statement outlining the candidate preferences of several foreign actors, National Counterintelligence and Security Center Director Bill Evanina also said China ""prefers that President Trump – whom Beijing sees as unpredictable – does not win reelection,"" and that Iran may try to ""undermine"" U.S. democratic institutions and the president, primarily through online and social media content. ""Many foreign actors have a preference for who wins the election, which they express through a range of overt and private statements; covert influence efforts are rarer,"" Evanina's statement said.

""The intelligence community's assessment that both China and Iran are trying to stop President Trump's re-election is concerning, but clearly because he has held them accountable after years of coddling by politicians like Joe Biden."" Tony Blinken, a Biden adviser, said, “Donald Trump has publicly and repeatedly invited, emboldened, and even tried to coerce foreign interference in American elections … Joe Biden, on the other hand, has led the fight against foreign interference for years, and has refused to accept any foreign materials intended to help him in this election - something that Donald Trump and his campaign have repeatedly failed to do.” Evanina wrote that China, which intelligence officials say does not interfere as actively or as purposely as Russia, ""prefers that President Trump — whom Beijing sees as unpredictable — does not win reelection."" ""China has been expanding its influence efforts ahead of November 2020 to shape the policy environment in the United States, pressure political figures it views as opposed to China's interests, and deflect and counter criticism of China,"" Evanina added.

China is a major competitor, and right now China wants to make a deal very badly. It's me, right now, that's holding up the deal. The President. And we're going to either do a great deal with China, or we're not doing a deal at all. Right now China is paying us billions and billions of dollars. They never gave us 10 cents. And China ate our country alive during Obama and Biden. They ate us alive. And then, Biden has some kind of relationship financially, or his son, with China?

And, Mr. President, a follow-up on North Korea: You tweeted about North Korea yesterday. Do you believe that they violated U.N. resolutions with the short-range missile launch? And does it give you pause at all to be appearing to side with a brutal dictator instead of with a fellow American, the former Vice President, Joe Biden?

498,"As we speak the US are developing a growing number of treatments, including convalescent plasma, that are saving lives all across the country.","What specific data or studies are available to demonstrate the effectiveness and increasing use of treatments like convalescent plasma in saving lives across the United States?		
Doctors and researchers are monitoring progress closely, as they know it will take time to determine how well convalescent plasma works. The strongest evidence regarding the effectiveness and safety of the experimental treatment will come from clinical trials. Since the first patients were approved by the FDA on a case-by-case basis, the FDA has now expanded access opportunities for doctors to help patients receive convalescent plasma. The government is now also supporting a National Expanded Access Treatment Program “to collect and provide convalescent plasma to patients in need across the country.”
		

What specific data or studies are available to demonstrate the effectiveness and increasing use of treatments like convalescent plasma in saving lives across the United States?		
Can you explain what is being done, and how many people have already received this convalescent therapy? It’s a complex question, so let’s try to unpack parts of it. The use in the United States, I can tell you that as of today there are probably about 9,000 people that have been treated. That is a large number of people that have received convalescent plasma. These people have been treated through what is called an investigational new drug that allows doctors to decide when this might be helpful. This is not clinical trials. This is a very large case series. We think that there is information there that we can mine.
		

What specific data or studies are available to demonstrate the effectiveness and increasing use of treatments like convalescent plasma in saving lives across the United States?		
As of mid-May, about 16,000 patients have been treated with convalescent plasma donated by people who have recovered from COVID-19. As donations increase, we’ll be able to use plasma to boost the immune systems of health care workers and first responders. The pharmaceutical industry is also using plasma donations to create standardized formulas of antibodies. Those will be superior products available in late summer/early fall.
		

What specific data or studies are available to demonstrate the effectiveness and increasing use of treatments like convalescent plasma in saving lives across the United States?		
Convalescent plasma is taken from the blood of people who have recovered from Covid-19. At the end of March, the FDA set up a pathway for scientists to try convalescent plasma with patients and study its impact. It has already been used to treat more than 60,000 Covid-19 patients. However, like blood, convalescent plasma is in limited supply and must come from donors. And while there are promising signals from some studies, there is not yet randomized clinical trial data on convalescent plasma to treat Covid-19. US Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said studies involving 70,000 volunteers justified the EUA.
		

What specific data or studies are available to demonstrate the effectiveness and increasing use of treatments like convalescent plasma in saving lives across the United States?		
With researchers around the world racing to develop a vaccine for COVID-19, attention is increasingly turning to a potential stop-gap measure – convalescent plasma. The yellowish gold part of our blood that contains antibodies to help fight viruses is the focus of research in labs and hospitals and shows early signs of promise. Notice: Transcripts are machine and human generated and lightly edited for accuracy. They may contain errors. As researchers race to develop a coronavirus vaccine, attention is increasingly turning to a potential stopgap measure called convalescent plasma.
		

What specific data or studies are available to demonstrate the effectiveness and increasing use of treatments like convalescent plasma in saving lives across the United States?		
In the past two weeks, blood centers across the U.S. have accelerated efforts to collect COVID-19 convalescent plasma on the theory it contains protective antibodies that can transfer immunity from a patient who had the disease to someone still suffering. The experimental practice was used during the devastating 1918 flu, as well as to treat measles in the 1930s. More recently, plasma therapy been used to treat victims of Ebola, SARS and H1N1 influenza. This year, an early review of five critically ill COVID-19 patients in China found that they appeared to improve after receiving convalescent plasma. But the treatment is only now being studied in multiple clinical trials. FDA officials made clear that while the agency authorized the treatment for emergency use in serious or critically ill COVID-19 patients, much remains unknown.
		

What specific data or studies are available to demonstrate the effectiveness and increasing use of treatments like convalescent plasma in saving lives across the United States?		
According to the Mayo Clinic, people who recover from COVID-19 do so, at least in part, because their blood contains antibodies which are capable of fighting the virus that causes the illness. Participating in a national, multicenter protocol will allow for analysis of many participants who receive plasma to help determine if this treatment is safe and effective, according to UC’s Huaman. He adds that the use of convalescent therapy dates back to the 1890s. Convalescent plasma has been used to prevent and/or treat a wide range of diseases including measles, SARS, Ebola, H1N1 flu and polio. Patients with COVID-19 may improve faster if they receive plasma from those who have recovered from COVID-19 because it may have the ability to fight the virus that causes it.
		

What specific data or studies are available to demonstrate the effectiveness and increasing use of treatments like convalescent plasma in saving lives across the United States?		
Health care providers who are considering using convalescent plasma to treat patients, either outside of a trial or in the context of a randomized trial Patients who have recovered from COVID-19 infection and are willing to donate plasma Patients with any stage of COVID-19 (or their families) who are considering this treatment Any member of the public interested in learning more about convalescent plasma use currently and in the past (see section on key papers)
		

What specific data or studies are available to demonstrate the effectiveness and increasing use of treatments like convalescent plasma in saving lives across the United States?		
“The data we gathered suggests that patients who were treated early in their disease course, within three days of being diagnosed, with plasma containing high levels of antibodies, benefited the most from treatment. We saw about a 35% better survival in the patients who benefited most from the treatment,” Azar told the White House briefing. “We dream in drug development of something like a 35% mortality reduction. This is a major advance in the treatment of patients. Azar appeared to be referring to a national study of 35,000 patients treated with convalescent plasma.
		

What specific data or studies are available to demonstrate the effectiveness and increasing use of treatments like convalescent plasma in saving lives across the United States?		
To date, this is the largest cohort worldwide assessed for outcomes pertaining to convalescent plasma transfusion for COVID-19. The findings are described in a paper published May 26 in The American Journal of Pathology. This is the first peer-reviewed publication on convalescent plasma use in the U.S. “While physician scientists around the world scrambled to test new drugs and treatments against the COVID-19 virus, convalescent serum therapy emerged as potentially one of the most promising strategies,” said James M. Musser, chair of the Department of Pathology and Genomic Medicine at Houston Methodist and corresponding author of the study. “With no proven treatments or cures for COVID-19 patients, now was the time in our history to move ahead rapidly.”
